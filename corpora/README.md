#Texts and Corpora

This directory contains corpora, both raw and pre-processed, used in creating the Mechanical Copybook.

Four authors are used - Mark Twain, Abraham Lincoln, and Oscar Wilde. The fourth, an amalgam of 20th and 21st century scribblings including Napoleon Hill, McSweeney's Internet Tendency, and Thought Catalog, is used as a zero-case. The program must, after all, recognize work that is not from one of the three main authors.

The corpora were assemble from Project Gutenberg. Only Oscar Wilde is missing an 'original' corpus. His works were assembled and cleaned from what Project Gutenberg had online, excluding Salome, which was written in French. Since each Wilde text was cleaned before it was added to the corpus, there is no 'original' file.
