Hey neighbor! Thatâ€™s my naked three-year-old jumping on the trampoline in your backyard. I just happened to notice last week that he really hit it off with your two daughters and I thought  well  heck  this is it! Weâ€™ve arrived! This is the village of 9- and 11-year-old girls it will take to raise my child!When we first moved to this neighborhood I had high hopes. I have always dreamed of finding that spirit of the old African proverb: â€œOmwana ni wa bhone â€ which means It takes a village of pretty much anyone other than myself to raise my child  wherever we end up. Before now  I have asked myself countless times over the course of my sonâ€™s life  WTF? Where is our village? How will I manage to do this on my own  with only my husband and the nice ladies at the daycare to take care of little Mylo 40 hours per week? And our regular babysitter who comes every Friday and Saturday evening from 6 to 10 so Rick and I can go out for dinner and a movie? And my mother-in-law who comes every Saturday afternoon from 12 to 6 so I can have some me time? And the motherâ€™s helper who comes every Sunday from 12 to 6 to take Mylo outside  away from me  while my husband enjoys his man time? And my sister who brings Mylo food when Rick and I are out of town? And the nice young people who work in the SmÃ¥land at Ikea  where I try to go two evenings per week so I can enjoy the ambience of the furniture displays  a nice plate of meatballs  and a cinnamon roll without having to think so much about the location of my child. â€œHe is in SmÃ¥land â€ I can whisper to myself periodically  and forget about him until it is time to leave. Except one time I whispered the phrase to myself so many times it lost all meaning and I didnâ€™t actually think about him until I got home and I noticed around bedtime that he wasnâ€™t there  but thatâ€™s another story. If I had had the village then that I have nowâ€¦ ah  well  it doesnâ€™t matter anymore  now  does it? Everyone is together again and thatâ€™s what matters.Yes  dear neighbors  I have had no village to help me raise this child  with the occasional exception of the nice people from the DSS. Until now.Do you see how Mylo so joyfully flings his body off the trampoline  and gets right back on it and does it again  and again  and again? This is the synergy of a three year old boy with 9- and 11-year old girls watching over him. It is a thing of beauty. Your daughters react with such concern â€” this is exactly what is needed in todayâ€™s world! It really does take a village. And I hope theyâ€™ve taken their first aid courses â€” especially the bits about choking and compound fractures. Iâ€™ve found those to be the most helpful in my own experience  because as you can see  Mylo loves to jump and eat. Jump and eat  jump and eat. Thatâ€™s what THAT little villager does. Oh  Mylo!Donâ€™t worry about him peeing on the trampoline as he just did; it will rain soon and everything will wash away. And yes  sometimes he flings his feces but thatâ€™s only when you really pressure him to use the toilet. Just donâ€™t pressure him  girls  and everyone and everything will theoretically be clean. But alsoâ€¦ if you could have him completely potty trained in the next two weeks that would be awesome. It really does take a village to potty train a child  donâ€™t you agree?I love to give Mylo as many opportunities as possible to be independent. So donâ€™t be surprised if he shows up at your door in the middle of the night wanting to climb into your beds from time to time. I told him he canâ€™t climb into mine anymore when Iâ€™m home but of course heâ€™s always welcome to check with the other villagers  as it were. Howâ€™s that for independence? Right? Thatâ€™s what all that doorbell ringing was about last night. If you would just answer the door straight away  or better yet  leave it unlocked  he could just climb right in and snuggle up with one of the girls  like a wiggly warm animal.  I think of Mylo as a cute little kitten that everyone secretly wishes would visit their homes.Also sometimes Rick has a business/leisure trip that overlaps with my own business/leisure trips so we just remember to put a box of Alphabits out for Mylo and heâ€™s pretty good about entertaining himself for a day or two until one of us gets home. We donâ€™t like to leave him on his own for much longer than that  but sometimes something unexpected comes up and weâ€™re delayed. This did not always go over so well in our old neighborhood  as nobody seemed to understand that it really really does take a village to raise our child except for perhaps the nice  yet grouchy  sometimes helpful  and otherwise frowny people at Child Protective Services who Omwana ni wa bhone-ed him for four months earlier this year. If thereâ€™s one thing I can say about them  itâ€™s this: they really step up when itâ€™s time to be the village. Surprise!So  neighbor  Iâ€™m so grateful for your albeit very small village â€” but a village nonetheless â€” of two nine and eleven-year-old daughters  who will now have the honor of helping me raise this child. Iâ€™ll send him over later with a rubber sheet and a box of Alphabits to get you started. Omwana ni wa bhone  amigos!           When you see something about the world that you donâ€™t like  and that doesnâ€™t fit with your ideas of justice  itâ€™s important that you take a stand against it.  Thatâ€™s why  when I looked at stats and read stories about inequality between men and women  about violence against women  and about how even in small  daily encounters  women are treated unfairly  I thought  â€œThis isnâ€™t right.  I should become a nice guy.â€  So thatâ€™s what I did.  And a lot has changed for me.My days of hooting at women on the street are over.  My days of hollering at women in hospitals and at church cookouts are long gone.  I now understand that a party might be an appropriate place to strike up a conversation with a woman  but a public bus that has been hijacked and will explode if it goes slower than 55 miles per hour quite simply isnâ€™t.  Even if the police save us  slipping her my phone number while she is talking to reporters and quietly sobbing is inappropriateWhen a woman treats me rudely  I no longer assume it must be because of her hormones.  Instead  I take into account the fact that I am in the middle of an intersection  am dancing a jig  and have been blocking traffic for well over forty-five minutes.  The traffic-blocking jig  though full of masculine  poetic energy  might have something to do with her curt tone.In the workplace  I am trying to be a better listener.  When a woman disagrees with one of my ideas  I no longer think that it must be because she is ugly  lonely  and secretly in love with me.  Instead  I consider the possibility that a competing company already executed the idea I mentioned  it poisoned eighty-nine children  and now that company is banned in twelve states and the E.U.  Often  on days when I listen closely like this  I reward myself with a treat  like takeout from an expensive restaurant.  It isnâ€™t a big deal â€” I have a very large salary.  Iâ€™m one of those nice guys.Romance can be a bit confusing for us nice guys.  Sometimes I hear that women like tough  macho men who have a hint of danger about them  and other times I hear women like sensitive  kind  funny guys who would make good long-term partners.  Itâ€™s possible to ask a woman on a first date what kind of partner sheâ€™s looking for  but women tend to talk for hours nonstop if you let them  so Iâ€™ve taken to splitting the difference.  Iâ€™ll open the door to a restaurant for a woman  then close it in her face and punch a wall.  Iâ€™ll offer to pay for the meal  then when the check comes Iâ€™ll light a napkin on fire and disappear out a bathroom window.  Sometimes Iâ€™ll text back the next day  other times it will be months and Iâ€™ll explain that Iâ€™ve changed my name and moved to Argentina.  This system has worked surprisingly well.  Iâ€™ve had over twenty-five first dates in the past year.In a certain way  I understand women better than I understand men.Although women are less intelligent than men and have more frivolous interests  a nice guy like me should never point that out.  Take fashion  for instance.  Men know that you should dress in a way that is utilitarian  modestly hip  and inexpensive.  Thatâ€™s where my sweatpantsuit idea came from.  Women think you should spend every waking hour researching new trends and shopping.  Pinterest!  Websites!  Crazy  I know â€” but I donâ€™t point out that I think itâ€™s crazy because Iâ€™m nice.  So when my female neighbor asks me if those are mustard stains on my sweatshirt and if the hole in my seat can perhaps be patched and if this is truly the life I imagined for myself  I donâ€™t get angry or frustrated.  I just feel superior.  Iâ€™m a nice guy.When a nice guy like me disagrees with a woman or doesnâ€™t like how heâ€™s being treated  what should he do?  Women like being the center of attention  so if you point out how you feel uncomfortable or disrespected  theyâ€™ll likely make the discussion about how they donâ€™t like how theyâ€™re being treated â€” and all of a sudden youâ€™re the bad guy.  No  the best tactic is a bit of judo: use their strengthâ€”the ability to get people to feel sorry for them â€” against them.  Instead of explaining why youâ€™re upset using reasons and logic  simply start crying.  Silent  slow tears at first  and then big  heaving wails.  Their nurturing instinct will kick in  they will comfort you  and if you mention a memory of your dead father  you just won every argument for the next week.  It doesnâ€™t matter that your father is still alive and is coming to visit for your birthday â€” what matters is that he feels dead in that moment.  See  a nice guy never has to argue to get his way.But thatâ€™s not all I have to do as a nice guy.  For instance  I am single  and it is important for me to explain to others that the reason Iâ€™m single is not because I am boring  have trouble relating to women  am privately prejudiced  and use niceness as a cover for thoughts that are hyper-sexualized and misogynistic.  No  the reason Iâ€™m single is because I am too nice!  Itâ€™s counterintuitive  so a nice guy like me needs to explain this to women in a way that is verbose and dumbed down.  Together  we can all make the world a better place for women  and the only thing we have to do is act on generalizations based on myths handed down by sexists who stand to gain economically and politically from systemic and social oppression.- -Chas Gillespie is the personal assistant of Dayn Rond  whose latest romance novel  Mr. Trump Meets Mr. Putin  is available now.

I know we have emailed and transferred calls to each other.  Weâ€™ve shared a good laugh at the size of the Styrofoam cups provided for the Keurig machine and speculated if the company has a deal with Staples to keep Green Mountainâ€™s Wild Mountain Blueberry k-cups fully replenished.  No one drinks Wild Mountain Blueberry.We have a solid work relationship.  Even though we are in competition for an additional 1.2% raise next quarter.  Weâ€™ve reached that comfortable status: associates who get along like friendsâ€”but will not be hanging-out on weekends togetherâ€”however  will agreeably carpool to happy hour with each other.  As such good associates  Iâ€™ve noticed how you look down every row of cubicles and peek into every office as you pass them by.  Itâ€™s been well observed that there is a nosey curiosity entwined in your DNA.  Therefore  I understand that the quarter inch space along the stall door can be quite tempting.  But this is the 21st Century and we are a civilized people.  You have crossed the line.As far as bathroom social etiquette goes  I thought nothing could be worse than Monica constantly jabbering on her blue tooth.  Her private phone calls invariably place me in the bleak position of debating as to whether or not I should continue with my bathroom affairs out of respect to her callers.  Over the past year  Iâ€™ve come to recognize the people she calls by their voices and consider them â€œfriends of a friend.â€  And they should receive some sort of courtesy.  Monicaâ€™s preferred phone booth is  of course  the handicap stall.  Whether or not we want it  Monica brings everyone into the personal business of her daughterâ€™s daycare schedule  her diabetic cat  and other family issues.  The least Monica could do is allow someone the glorious privilege of access to the most spacious stall.  And refusing to grant that  then maybe she should be a little more wiling to take advice from others during lunch break.  Sheâ€™s brought a lot of women in on her nieceâ€™s behavior problems and the contents of what your tabby hacked-up that morning.  We are women. We like to give our opinion.  Monica  you brought this on yourself.Over time  Iâ€™ve become quite the expert on bathroom habits of my coworkers.  And not all are as disgusting and invasive as you  Cindy.  There are the competitive sorts.  These few are very busy and rarely take the time to sympathize with their bladders. These executive whizzers are in and out of the bathroom with such a ferocious pace that a reply to a high importance email could barely been received.  There are those who try to make it through the whole day in an attempt to only use their home toilet but just didnâ€™t quite make it and expel an excited â€œAAHhhhâ€¦â€ around 4:42 pm.  And let us not forget the multitude who go to the bathroom merely to stretch their legs and send a few text messages.  I know all of these types.  And I know who falls under which category based on her foot attireâ€¦ which has also made me quite aware of whoâ€™s phone I should never ever EVER touch  no matter what cute puppy and baby picture is being shared.I once thought the women who freely used the bathroom for all its intended plumbing design were simply the worst.  There was a time I when I was so appalled by how selfish the coworkers with the gluten intolerances took command over the ladiesâ€™ bathroom.  They produced sounds like amateur beat-boxers and odors that sent us all jumping off the docks like unsuspecting Parisians who crossed paths with Pepe Le Pew.  This applied to the vegan in IT as well.  Although  I learned my disgust was really just masked jealousy.  While waiting for everyone to leave the bathroom  so my business could commence  I self-reflected.  After all  Iâ€™m a multitasker by nature.  It was during a moment of pinching tightly when I came to realize that it wasnâ€™t disgust over those women who could be so free-wheeling in making their waste buckets  but rather envy that I was too ashamed to do the same.  Why didnâ€™t I have the chutzpah to let my freak flag fly?  Throw caution to the wind?  Get on with your bad self!But you  Cindy  have gone much too far.  Yours is a behavior of which I do not encourage nor wish I possessed.  How can you possibly expect me to listen to your report  even though it slightly improves my chance for an additional 1.2% salary increase next quarter?  Iâ€™m far too preoccupied by your deviant behavior.  Did you have time to notice what I was doing in the bathroom when we locked eyes?  Was I tidying-up or in the moment of expelling that awful Green Mountain Keurig coffee that we so besmirched earlier that week?  Did you notice my undergarment and silently ridicule it â€¦or un-silently ridicule it to other employees?  Do I wear the Wild Mountain Blueberry of underwear?  Did you just say â€œterrible Keurig coffeeâ€ or am I hearing things?  Wait  what was on that last PowerPoint slide? It was a blueberry  wasnâ€™t it?  Wasnâ€™t it?!?!  Great  the peeing-peeping Tom has made a mockery of me.  This presentation is very good.  But maybe the presentation began behind the closed door to the womenâ€™s rest room.  Enjoy your sixteen cent raise.  The victory is yours  Cindy.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3|Hello  distant acquaintances! Have you heard theyâ€™re having another election? Itâ€™s true! You know Iâ€™m a levelheaded fellow without a strong party preference or political ideology  but I pride myself on doing my homework before participating in this sacred institution of American democracy. And by that I mean that I read your Facebook and Twitter posts. The good news is that Iâ€™m just now starting to pay attention to this crazy horserace we call an election  and my openness to new points of view is rivaled only by my delicate  morally conventional sense of propriety  so I sure hope nothing shocking or unconventional has transpired!Have you heard about Donald Trump? From what Iâ€™ve gathered  heâ€™s a successful businessman who used to have a popular TV show! Whatâ€™s next  a Hollywood movie star as president?? Oh wait  I think we already had one â€” so I guess that means Trump is a lot like Reagan  a president who is remembered with universal fondness? I would certainly be taken aback if a prominent family member or former colleague of Reaganâ€™s made a passionate case to the contrary â€” such an unexpected turn of events would cause me to reassess my torpid openness to a Trump presidency!Still  success in the world of real estate sounds like a solid basis for becoming our Commander in Chief  wouldnâ€™t you say? From what Iâ€™ve been able to gather from glancing at muted cable news channels while drinking in safari-themed airport bars  Trump fits the bill. I guess the only way so solid a case could be undermined were if a prominent economist or public intellectual published an editorial opposing Trump  or arguing that he hasnâ€™t actually been successful at all  given his privileged background. But what are the odds of that  and even if it had happened  where could I find such editorials? Iâ€™m lost!Speaking of editorials  if youâ€™re like me  you allow the people who edit major newspapers to make most of the key decisions in your life. Who knows â€” one of them might be Superman! Imagine if an historically conservative paper  instead of endorsing the Republican candidate as one would almost certainly expect  actually endorsed the Democrat! I would involuntarily spit my milk out on my spouse  who is also on the fence about whom to vote for this year.But if thereâ€™s one thing that I wonâ€™t compromise on itâ€™s respect for women. Call me old fashioned  but I believe itâ€™s never appropriate to call women fat pigs  make public reference to their menstruations  or unexpectedly grab them by the nethers. And that goes double for former Miss. Universe winners! But I have no reason to think Donald Trump figures into this discussion at all  and frankly I canâ€™t think of anyone in the White House whoâ€™d set a better example for women and girls. I wish that I could!Free trade and immigration are also important issues to me  though I couldnâ€™t tell you exactly how or why. I just know something has to be done! But my steadfast moral compass means any instance of bigotry or intolerance are absolute deal-breakers â€” right up there with insulting Vietnam-era POWs  or mocking the disabled. Any idea where I might find information about whether any of the candidates have exhibited such troubling character flaws? It might make the difference in this election were I to see someone post an article about it!I guess staying well-informed is harder than I thought  but with your guysâ€™ help  Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll figure this out eventually. The important thing to remember is that people like me absolutely exist and are in no way a figment of your imagination! So when youâ€™re posting half a dozen Trump articles per day  you and I know itâ€™s because youâ€™re a true patriot  and not just a leech on whatever dwindling pleasure social media brings to your friendsâ€™ wretched lives.Sincerely Undecided (but still thinking Trump is a pretty solid choice â€” prove me wrong!)P.S. Any opinions about the Bernie-or-bust movement? They make some good points!|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4|1.

You see  I used to cast my vote for the candidate who seemed like someone I could have a beer with. That was all fine and good back then  but times have changed. Iâ€™m now looking for a candidate who tells it like it is.Can you help me?Iâ€™m searching for a candidate who uses short sentences with simple words  like maybe one to three words max. Because  hi  regular American people donâ€™t think or talk in paragraphs. Also  none of this long form mumbo jumbo about â€œactual policiesâ€ or â€œliterally just give us even two details about how youâ€™ll achieve any of this tremendous  classy magic you claim youâ€™ll perform on this countryâ€ Show me a candidate who speaks plain â€” and I mean real plain â€” E-N-G-L-I-S-H!Preferably this dream candidate would repeat the most meaningless stock phrases over and over again  to the delight of the Ku Klux Klan and roadside sign makers everywhere. Iâ€™d especially feel favorable towards a candidate who doubles down on insults when cornered. Heard of anyone like that?Iâ€™m looking for a candidate who can bring sexism and misogyny out of the shadows and into the bright light of day. Iâ€™m hoping this candidate will make many  many remarks about womenâ€™s bodies and faces and whatâ€™s good and not good about them. I know what youâ€™re thinking  youâ€™re probably wondering  â€œWait  arenâ€™t YOU a woman?â€ and while liberals like to throw around the phrase â€œinternalized misogynyâ€ when they meet me  I just tell them that that sounds like something they should have checked out at the clinic. I should know  I was just there. Anyway  if you know of anyone who could put women down in about a hundred different ways and make them feel incredibly unsafe and concerned about the future  sign me up.Related to that  I like a candidate who puts women in their place because Iâ€™m a woman and I seriously need someone to tell me what my place is. Is my place here? Is it over there? Someone tell me! Iâ€™m also open to suggestions of where I could be grabbed without my consent. Iâ€™d personally assume â€œarm â€ but Iâ€™m ready for a highly immoral and illegal game changer of an answer. To add on to that  I would owe you big time if you could recommend a candidate who has a creepy and public attraction to one of his daughters while publicly shunning his other daughter. Thatâ€™d just be perfect. Here  write his name down on this Post-it note here.Iâ€™m hoping to find a candidate who brings back what used to make America great â€” belittling people. It was funny in 8th grade and itâ€™s funny now! So if you could track down a candidate who likes to insult people when it comes to their gender  race  ethnicity  physical ability  marriage status  eggheadedness and/or even just their imaginary slights  comments  or qualities  Iâ€™d really appreciate it. Bonus points if the mood created by those insults also carries with it a halo of future physical harm by this candidateâ€™s supporters. Bring all that great American stuff back and my vote is as good as cast.Iâ€™m also in the market for a candidate who lies and I do mean LIES. None of this little white lies business or political â€œspin â€ Iâ€™m looking for a candidate who really puts his back into it. You know  someone who doesnâ€™t know how to wear pants that arenâ€™t completely engulfed in fire. The kind of candidate who just smirks  tells a lie that quite literally everyone knows is a lie  and then leans back and watches his favorability ratings go up. Know anyone like that? If so  please write his name on this piece of paper and slide it across the table to me like weâ€™re doing some kind of big shot business deal.Additionally  Iâ€™d like to find a candidate who will work closely with other governments  say  the Russian government for example. My ideal candidate would find ways to bring people into our political process who have proven capable of reaching across the globe to poison and kill people who have crossed them. If youâ€™ve heard of a candidate who meets these requirements  could you have him call me? I just know itâ€™ll be a him.If youâ€™re familiar with a candidate who could put this country in a more precarious position  both domestically and internationally  thatâ€™d be amazing. Iâ€™d prefer this candidate to be a loose cannon of the highest order  maybe someone whoâ€™d suggest something zany like banning an entire religious group and would send people scurrying to Google as if itâ€™s a crystal ball  furiously tapping away on their keyboards something like  â€œIs this how the Holocaust started?â€ So if you come across someone like that  text me.Oh  I almost forgot  if this candidate could be exceptionally thin-skinned and incapable of counting to ten before responding that would just hit the nail on the head for me. Someone who is highly irrational while also being highly reactionary is  to me  the ideal candidate for the most powerful office in the land. â€œShoot first on 5th Avenue and ask questions later â€ thatâ€™s what I always say. If youâ€™ve heard through the grapevine of this kind of elusive and media shy candidate  do tell.Lastly â€” and this is really a deal breaker if it canâ€™t happen â€” Iâ€™m especially in the market for a candidate who has the potential to incite so much chaos and global unrest that the Earth will careen off of its axis  get sucked into a death orbit  and be sent hurtling straight into the sun  much to the profound relief of all of its inhabitants.If youâ€™ve got any recommendations along those lines  give me a shout. Iâ€™ll be waiting with race-baited breath.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             8|The WhopperitoSubmitted by Meg ThompsonThe Whopperito sat alone in my stomach  thinking about what it had done  which was loosen the moral boundaries that keeps sandwich genres to themselves.Like most 30-somethings with a liberal arts degree  I put off home ownership because I didnâ€™t want to buy a lawnmower. I savored not knowing what the word â€œescrowâ€ meant  and spent my evenings drinking wine and perusing esoteric wedding registries. But then  in no particular order  I had a baby and bought a Honda CR-V and started getting drunk on something else: The American Dream.And thatâ€™s how I ended up in the drive-through lane at Burger King  whispering the name of their latest portmanteau into the speaker.Do you want the meal or just the Whopperito?I listened for the tone of the employeeâ€™s voice coming through. Are we in on this joke together? Is the cruelest part of this market plan the fact that she has to ask these questions? Can she see me?Just the Whopperito.Iâ€™m sad enough  thank you.Also  who eats FRIES with a Whopperito?I couldnâ€™t believe how many times we had to utter â€œWhopperitoâ€ to one another. I longed for the conversation to be over  but like a Garth Brooks coming-out-of-retirement-concert  it just kept going.Once I was safely at home with the doors locked and blinds drawn  I set my Whopperito on the table and unfolded the tortilla. It dawned on me that the Whopperito is essentially a burrito with pickles. The other ingredients: meat  lettuce  tomato  are fluid food items that can easily wend their way into many of our everyday meals. Was the Whopperito all that different? Was it like when Apple makes the slightest variation on the charger so we all have to go buy a new one?If you havenâ€™t already guessed  I am not what you might call a â€œfoodie.â€ I was raised by my mother  who thinks ice in a glass of water or a sandwich with two kinds of cheese count as â€œexcessive.â€ I am merely a self-labeled  post-modern consumer  savoring all the levels our country has to offer. I have dined at well-to-do establishments  like those McDonaldâ€™s that have a chandelier and an upstairs  and the ones that are inside turnpike gas stations. In my eyes  I see little difference  but I guess thatâ€™s just the way I was raised.Similar to my MFA in creative writing  however  the Whopperito let me down. Neither Whopper nor burrito  I felt overwhelmed by the inevitable slippery slope I was riding down  but if burgers and burritos can unite in marriage  why canâ€™t the rest of us?On the Burger King website  the Whopperito is listed under the â€œchicken & moreâ€ menu category. I actually find this to be the most alarming development of the Whopperito. Talk about a slippery slope  not to mention imprecision. However  I suppose â€œchicken & linguistic blends of words â€ illustrates a showy  heightened form of self-awareness Burger King is not ready to embrace.- - -Chinaâ€™s Green Tea Ice Cream OreoSubmitted by Kaya YorkThe most wonderful thing I learned while living in China is of the great diversity of corporate snack flavors around the world. Oreos  for example. Thereâ€™s a lot of Oreos out there. The Oreo Wikipedia page has a pretty comprehensive and surprisingly well-cited documentation of Oreo variations with comically officious (and borderline Nietzschean) section headings like â€œBeyond Sandwich Cookiesâ€.Itâ€™s mysterious in what way Oreo flavors are facilitated through the idea of ice cream.  How does ice cream figure in  ontologically speaking? Why not simply a green tea flavored Oreo? Were they afraid we would think it wasnâ€™t sweet? Like that it was gonna be an Oreo that actually tasted like tea? The natural hope is for a brand-crossover ice cream called Green Tea Ice Cream Oreo Ice Cream.But still I get it. Green Tea Ice Cream is delicious. Oreos are delicious. The idea of putting them together does not disgust me like the Double Delight Oreo series that combines orange/mango  raspberry/blueberry  and grape/peach. These taste like toothpaste. A cookie should not be refreshing.I was excited to try the Green Tea Ice Cream Oreo.They were sold to me by the å¸‚æ–¤ (jin â€” about a pound) out of a bucket of individually packaged Oreos  which made me feel like I was buying a timeless staple-like grain.I was disappointed.It didnâ€™t taste anything like green tea flavored ice cream. Or green tea. Or ice cream. It tasted a little like mint. Like a parched Girl Scouts Grasshopper cookie. But I checked: it enthusiastically claimed itself to be green tea flavored ice cream flavored.Eat this cookie only if you wish to be reminded of all the things in the world that do not live up to their potential. Or donâ€™t. The orangutans will thank you. But still go to China for the green tea toothpaste. Thatâ€™s actually very good.- - -Burger Kingâ€™s Mac n CheetosSubmitted by Stacey GreenbergWhen Taco Bell came out with the Doritos Locos Tacos we were all ecstatic. Taco Bell and Doritos together?  I mean  how could life get any better than that? As a child of the 70s and a mom  I was 100% impressed by their genius marketing team (which probably consisted of people in their 20s). I didnâ€™t even care that the shell wasnâ€™t actually a giant Dorito  just the same old shell with Doritos flavored powder on it.Fast forward a few years and now we have Burger Kingâ€™s retort  the Mac n Cheetos. What. The. Fuck. How do they get the macaroni to cooperate long enough to be encased in the Cheetos shell? What on earth must go into the Cheetos shell to make it strong enough to contain the macaroni? And is it fried? There are just so many questions I want to remain unanswered.Oddly enough  the Mac n Cheetos hit my radar via a vegan friend on Facebook. She was lamenting the fact that she would never know the pleasure of the Mac n Cheetos. My first thought was  â€œEw is there meat in them too?â€ Then I remembered that vegans donâ€™t eat cheese. I could see the Mac n Cheetos turning just about anybody off of cheese eternally  assuming it actually contains real cheese  which surely it doesnâ€™t. Ew  maybe there is meat in there too. Or ground up baby cow hoofs. Or that pesky gelatin that ruins so many things for vegans.Because my now fourteen-year-old son only talks to me if it pertains to food (as in me buying him food  preparing him food  carrying food to him while he lays in bed watching YouTube)  I asked  â€œHey did you see the new Cheetos thing at Burger King?â€His eyes lit up  and he showed a level of excitement I hadnâ€™t seen since agreeing to buy him four burritos at Chipotle a couple of weeks prior. â€œThe Mac n Cheetos! Letâ€™s go!â€ he said.Iâ€™ll be honest. I wanted to go get them not just because I basically will do anything to keep my teenage son from getting hangry  but because I had to see one in person. Then I remembered we had just discussed the fact that heâ€™d eaten a whole bag of pork rinds at his dadâ€™s house the night before and had been suffering some pretty ill effects most of the morning. â€œLetâ€™s wait until you can go several hours without using the restroom â€ I suggested.After having a few days to think about my offer of driving to Burger King  making the order for one Mac n Cheetos and paying with money I earned myself  I had second thoughts. Mostly of the fourteen year old becoming addicted to Mac n Cheetos and this being the first of many  many trips  especially since I had officially refused to ever go to Chik fil-A again.We made a deal between the menu board and the pay window. He could have one order  and his little brother and I would each have one bite. The experience would be Snapchatted and then weâ€™d all move on with our lives.In the plus column  they didnâ€™t take extra time to cook like the stoopid Buffalo Chicken Fries. The packaging is attractive. The actual product is quite a sight to beholdâ€”a tube with lots of little tubes inside. Totally tubular!In the minus column  they just taste like super soft and cheesy fake cheese wrapped in mildly crunchy even faker cheese. They are truly disgusting and cause you to feel all the shame you knew you would. Unless you are fourteen. And then your eyes roll back into your head and you tell your mom that youâ€™ve achieved nirvana.- - -All-Natural 100% Veggies Sweet Corn Crunch Dried Kernels Sprinkled With Sea SaltSubmitted by Amy BarnesI am a city girl. For a 70s summer  I was a country girl. Back then it was a real farm and not a $4 000-a-week yuppy kid summer camp experience with free-range chickens and sustainable meals prepared by Wolfgang Puck. A tween boy drove my sister and I around a Kansas farm in a truck that was older than his dad. I stepped in pig poop. And horse poop. Dog poop. Chicken poop. Lots and lots of poop. After the requisite feeding of the animals in the poop  we should have all cleaned up before our next farm-related fun: the dry feed corn silo. We did not.The dry feed corn silo was a wonderland. We climbed the long and rusty metal ladder to the top and shimmied in through the equally rusty submarine-style entry at the top. And then we jumped. Like kids into the first uber-cold swimming pool water. Into dry corn. Poop-covered pants  shoes and all. And slid down probably 40 or 50 feet to the bottom. Screaming and giggling. I now know as an adult that was a very  very  very dangerous thing to do. My mother was sitting on the front porch of the farmhouse drinking tea unaware or didnâ€™t care that she might lose both of her daughterâ€™s to dried corn. It was the 70s. The poetic justice of all that farm poop returning to the animals on their feed aside  the three of us could have died. It was far more dangerous than the 11-year-old driving a stick shift truck at 50 miles an hour through the farm. However  there is nothing like the smell and feel of dried corn on a hot Kansas summer afternoon. The corn dust on your clothes. In your hair. The smell of that corn sucks into your lungs (in much the way that a big mouthful of that same corn might also kill you). You are instantly drowning and sliding on the best roller coaster ever. 35 years later  I thought I would never live that experience again. There is no way in hell that I would willingly climb that ladder and take that plunge now.  Get ready all you fellow city slickers. However  farm summers are here again for everyone! I have found the suburb  middle-aged version of the farm silo corn:All-Natural 100% Veggies Sweet Corn Crunch Dried Kernels Sprinkled with Sea Salt.Apparently  the company thinks their product is not good enough on its own and so they include ALL of the following information on the bag:Non-GMO Project  Sensible Foods Crunch Dried Kernels  Corn  sea salt and nothing else (trademark)  meets USDA â€œSmart Snacks in Schoolâ€ Guidelines  packed in a facility free from peanuts  gluten  dairy and eggs  vegan  gluten free  non GMO  low fat  no additives  no sugar added  no preservatives  kosher certified  Perfect topping: salads  soups  salsas  excellent addition to stews  casseroles  pizza or tacos  A delicious ingredient for baking or trail mix  tasty snack right out of the bag  satisfy corn cravings 100% sweet corn and nothing else  picked at peak of ripeness  lightly dusted with sea salt  crunch dried  ideal for any eating occasion  re-sealable  perfectly amazing on the go snack anytime  anywhere  Office  enjoy with a movie  or refuel on a hike  Best by 08/03/2017Seriously  just say:Our dried corn is a Kansas farm summer. Minus death by dry-corn-drowning and farm animal poop.This stuff is city-girl nostalgia crack. I do eat it on salads and on-the-go and maybe even on top of my green eggs and ham.  Maybe not on tacos or stews (really stewâ€”what marketing writer adds in stews?) but you have to draw the line somewhere. You have just avoided death by silo and can buy this remarkably simple product at Costco. Costco. Costco! Just take it up the register and pull out your Costco membership card and say   â€œIâ€™d like one bag of summer corn.â€ No  donâ€™t say that. They might think you are crazy and might take away your bag of Â½ eaten corn. Because now you will have to open the bag in the store and eat it before you pay for it and you will be standing there with a Volkswagen-sized tub of ice cream melting while eating dried corn out of the bag and weeping that you need to have backyard chickens (home chicken coop â€” aisle 6).  Just put the bag-o-corn on the conveyor belt and pray that all the loose corn doesnâ€™t roll back down and drown the toddler perched screaming  covered in poop in the next cart down.Proof positive that you CAN put the country (corn) into a city girl all over again.- - -Trader Joeâ€™s Shooting StarsSubmitted by Ellen RhundyAs a 30-year-old woman who drinks her coffee from a NASA mug (a gift from your parents after a crushing but earthbound layoff)  it should come as no surprise that you are drawn to the packaging of Trader Joeâ€™s Shooting Stars cookies. A star-shaped cookie? Drizzled with chocolate? And a drawing of a spaceship? And a drawing of an astronaut? Sold!Alas  these are cookies you should have considered more closely before purchase. Out of the packaging  they are just as they appear on the box  with the added bonus of crumbled graham cracker sprinkled atop the chocolate drizzles. It is 10 AM but work is tough  and a donut is really just a cookie in disguiseâ€”so in you go  only to find the cookie exploding against your lip  a piece of graham cracker ricocheting off your desk as you stare in shock at the devil cookie. You cautiously launch its return trip towards your wounded lip  but pause: the cookie is fizzing  crackling  another graham cracker crumb has flung itself free  to be discovered hours later implacably attached to your jeans.In your pure love for the stars  you realize you failed to notice one critical fact: these cookies are covered in fucking pop-rocks. The only appropriate home for Trader Joeâ€™s Shooting Stars is the office kitchen  absent their packaging  where you sit giggling nervously every time a coworker is about to be deceived just as you were a few short hours ago. But not again  bucko. Not again.- - -Reynaldoâ€™s Rice PuddingSubmitted by Julia CervantesItâ€™s 2 PM on a Thursday afternoon  the weekly nadir of my dietary willpower. Each week is a Sisyphean struggle to avoid the snacks at the office marketplace. My inert lifestyle is in league with my pants  and together they refuse to be accommodating of sweets.The marketplace is on the opposite side of the office  roughly 600 steps from my desk. I try to make this journey every two hours (for my cardiovascular health  naturally)  and that brings me into contact with temptation approximately 20 times per week. Thatâ€™s twenty opportunities for me to lose my grip  and the moment I do I feel triumphant in my own defeat. (Did not Sisyphus feel the same surge of wild  pointless joy at his momentary easement?) I paw through the chips  trail mixes  and candy bars with unfettered glee. I shiver mostly from excitement as I peruse the refrigerated section  and then I see it. The ancestors have shown me favor this day in the form of my favorite  but rarely stocked  delicacyâ€”Reynaldoâ€™s Rice Pudding.The logo  a man dark of hair and pale of skin  looks a bit like me that one time I wore a sombrero for Cinco de Mayo and drew a mustache on myself with a sharpie. The label proclaims it to be both Rice Pudding and Arroz con Leche  a duality that I can appreciate. It proclaims  like that government census I filled out  that White and Hispanic can and often do label the same package.Thatâ€™s all well and good on paper  but if someone in my open-plan office asks what Iâ€™m eatingâ€”and some nosy desk mate willâ€”I will refer to it strictly as rice pudding. Despite being half Hispanic  I am translucently pale and was raised by white people of European descent. To pepper my speech with Spanish and ineptly roll my râ€™s would invite only the incredulity of my colleagues. Such is the nature of my own duality.Ethnic anxieties aside  I get down to the best part of my workweek. The lid is a thin  tear-away film  but not one of those membranous manhole covers so fused to the round plastic lip of the container that it precipitates a fierce tooth-and-nail-and-very-often-knife struggle. No. This lamina lifts away with the subtlest allusion to force by my weakened and benumbed carpal-tunnel-stricken hands.The semi-solid top skin of the pudding looks like the cinnamon-flecked  highly folded brain of a deeply intelligent species. As I push the spoon into its depths  I imagine myself in an ancient rain forest eating from the cavity of a small monkeyâ€™s skull. The texture of the pudding beneath the surface skin is best described as quantal; the creamy lumpiness is either entirely sublime or utterly revolting  depending on your textural preferences and powers of imagination. As for the taste  there can be nothing in heaven or on earth that is more satisfying than full-fat dairy with sugar and cinnamon.- - -McDonaldâ€™s Signature Sriracha Big Mac SauceSubmitted by Thomas CookRight  so the first question youâ€™re asking yourself is the first question I neglected to ask myself: is this a sauce or a sandwich? The answer: itâ€™s a sauce. Maybe if I had paid closer attention to the commercial before putting away the end of a bottle of wine and heading for the drive-thru I would have known this  but instead I steamed into the parking lot and tried to order the â€œSriracha Sandwich.â€ No such thing.I should point out that I donâ€™t recommend finishing a bottle of wine and heading for McDonaldâ€™s in search of McDonaldâ€™s Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce in general  necessarily  mainly because of the drinking and driving dimension of the act  but also because research tells me this sauce may be  at least for a time  available in Los Angeles and San Diego only  the former being where I tracked it down.It had been awhile since Iâ€™d driven thru a McDonaldâ€™s  so itâ€™s probably worth saying also  in case youâ€™re in the same boat as I was  that things have changed. The first thing you should know is that thereâ€™s now a Signature Sandwich Menu (at least here in L.A.)  and knowing that is key to placing a coherent order  that is if you see a commercial for an addition to the sauce portion of the menu and are compelled at that very movement to pursue the sauce on a sandwich  as I was.For instance  had you known about the menu  you likely would have nodded your head or produced some equivalent gesture of ascent at the news of a spicy addendum to an existing menu of sauces (i.e.  Creamy Dijon Mustard  Sweet BBQ Sauce  and Pico de Gallo) that now  at second glance  seemed to have been missing such a thing. Unfortunately for Kareem  the kind gentleman who guided me through the process of â€œbuilding my own sandwichâ€ in the drive-thru  I had no such prior knowledge of the sauce line-up or the menu in general.(I should point out that there is good chance  based on how I likely sounded  coupled with my ignorance of the menu  that Kareem may have regarded me as damaged.)Kareem first led me through the selection of a bun product â€” Artisan Roll  Potato Bun  or Sesame Seed Bun â€” to which I deferred to him. He expressed his preference for the Potato Bun  and I said that if it was good enough for him it was good enough for me.Next  I chose from the options of a 100% Pure Beef Patty  Buttermilk Crispy Chicken or Artisan Grilled Chicken. Here  I did not hesitate. Having seen the sandwich in the commercial advertised with the Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce spread over a beef patty  there was only one choice.Eventually  I ended up with a beef patty served on a potato roll with the promised Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce  white cheddar  crispy onions  a spinach/kale blend  and a tomato. I began eating as I pulled away from Kareem  thanking him for his help through the ordering process.What I can report  I must admit  could potentially be colored by my previously admitted McDonaldâ€™s hiatus: in a nutshell  McDonaldâ€™s has done it. This sandwich  at least as constructed with the potato roll and beef patty  is a funhouse of flavor and texture. The crispy onions  though I could have done with more  maintained their crunch while at the same time sinking in to the partially melted slice of white cheddar. I attribute this to the onion-to-cheddar ratio  and so recommend that  if the product makes it out to more markets  the amount of cheese is upped along with the amount of onions.As regards the kale/spinach blend  the raw nature of the leaves was a bit of an issue. As I drove and ate  looking down at the sandwich to gaze upon what I had created  it appeared (and tasted) as though the leaves of kale and spinach simply wilted upon contact with the other hot ingredients  darkening  falling off of the sandwich  sullying my lap. A sautÃ©ed blend might perform better and stay inbounds.The roll â€” Kareem was right â€” I found both sweet and also substantial  absorbing of the access fat and cooking liquid  though not soaking through  the gummy starchiness of the potato shining in its compliment of the beef patty.And then of course the sauce. McDonaldâ€™s Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce is on the sweeter side of Sriracha. It is  I confirmed  simply Sriracha mixed in with Original Big Mac Sauce  which means itâ€™s really good.- - -Nabisco Oreo Strawberry Shortcake Sandwich CookiesSubmitted by Katie WalshI have been an avid Oreo lover since I was old enough to eat solid food. I have fond memories of deconstructing these sinful sandwiches with my dad and stacking them back together with peanut butter  whipped cream  and other sweets to make towering  saccharine-filled monstrosities that would make any dentist cringe. (My dad actually is a dentist  making this even more ironic.) Needless to say  when my fiancÃ© and I saw the Strawberry Shortcake variety at our local Walmart one innocuous Friday afternoon  I nearly trampled some kids in the aisle on the way to grab a bag. (Side note: Walmart is the only  and I mean ONLY  place we have been able to find these fucking things â€“ meaning that whenever I get a craving for them  I must first endure horrific parking lots  masses of stupidity  and blinding florescent lights before I can finally tear into the famous blue bag. But thatâ€™s an entirely different story.)Over the years  whenever Oreo has released a new flavor  I have always been first in line to try them: lemon  gingerbread  mint  even the various flavors in the super-chocolatey â€œFudge Cremeâ€ line. My favorite has always been the white chocolate-covered Oreos that show up around the holidays â€“ until now. These have the golden Oreo cookie with a strawberry cream filling  and are a total game-changer. As soon as we got home we each poured a tall glass of whole milk (fuck that 2% bullshit â€” if Iâ€™m going to indulge  Iâ€™m committing 100%) and brought the bag into our room  where we closed the curtains  turned on Netflix  and ripped them open.The first thing we noticed was the aroma: In my 33 years on this Earth  I have tried many a â€œstrawberry-shortcake-flavoredâ€ treat  only to be severely disappointed (and  truthfully  pissed) by the end result. Not with these. Nabisco did it right  my friend. These little sons of bitches tasted like the best strawberry shortcake dessert I could ever imagine. I like to twist  eat one cookie first  lick the cream off the second  and then dip the naked cookie into milk and eat it  while my fiancÃ© dunks the whole cookie at once and eats it lke that. I recommend eating these fuckers any way you can â€” there is no wrong way. The golden Oreos served as a perfect foil to the strawberry cream â€” the shortcake part of the dessert  if you will. Suffice it to say that we devoured that entire goddamn bag in one sitting  and were only left wanting more. We made three more unnecessary  horrendous  migraine-inducing trips to Walmart that weekend alone  each trip resulting the same way â€” shame â€” eating the entire package by ourselves in the dark.- - -Starbucks â€œPink Drinkâ€Submitted by Ella GonzalezLike most millennials and individuals of the 21st century  I believe that the foods and beverages I consume should be photogenic and contain no less than two whole avocados. They are an extension of my four cavities and counting  a culinary expression of floundering in a deep sea of my own pretension. Each bite and every morsel and crumb is at risk of being photographed  and even when theyâ€™re not  the thought of having Instagram-able food is one of the greatest achievements of all. If food has a purpose  itâ€™s to stand (lie in repose?) behind the camera to not be consumed.I tried the new Starbucks â€œpink drinkâ€ for a similar reason and ratio of superficiality: 90% because it looks cool; 10% so I could be the first of my friends. If there were a lull in any conversation  my sampling of this trendy beverage would diffuse the tension. â€œHave you guys tried the pink drink?â€ I would ask. The conversation would pick up  coconut milk wins again.Wrong.The â€œpink drinkâ€ â€” Starbucksâ€™ strawberry acai refresher with coconut milk instead of water â€” is as disappointing as it is difficult to say.Described as a pink Starburst liquefied  it combines the right amount of disappointment with â€œI paid four bucks for this?â€ It sure tastes like pink Starburst  which is good if youâ€™re eating a pink Starburst  otherwise itâ€™s a beverage committing fraud. Its pink Starburst taste is second to the disappointment that follows an ill ratio of coconut milk to the freeze-dried Lunchable meat powder the strawberry acai sat in for the past decade. Coconut milk  like itâ€™s older sibling and sewer water stunt double  coconut water  is a sorry excuse for a milk replacement. It tasted like a pink Starburst soaked in tepid skim milk with too many ice cubes left overnight in an old bodega.Watery and disappointing like Lunchable meat.But itâ€™s pretty enough to photograph  and there my priorities lay.- -JuXiangYuan Health Food Co. Almond Cookies with Lard Center  China Time-honored BrandSubmitted by Jenn MarThey watch you  the office guinea pig  cross-examining a box of cookies Mei had smuggled 7 019 miles from China  under the most frightening conditions of airplane turbulence in an economy-class toilet stall. Mummified in layers of newspaper  the cookies had spent 12 hours buried at the bottom of Meiâ€™s purse beneath a sweater and complimentary in-flight banana. Leave it to a middle-aged Chinese woman to disguise a restricted agricultural item â€” exported almond cookies â€” as a discrete package resembling stashed cocaine.Staring vacantly at the box  Derrick from I.T. shares his gloomiest expression. On appearance alone  the box ought to be filled with utilitarian items â€” dietary capsules  herbal remedies  gunpowder. Uninspired in design  the striped orange and green box couldâ€™ve been lifted straight from the archives of TIME  in a photo of decimated state-run communist markets  during a time of scarcity when shelves were nearly always emptied of food  well  except for the â€œJuXiangYuan China Time-honored Brand Almond Cookies with Lard Center.â€ At least in your historical reimagining.Beneath the wrapper is a stony disk stamped with a mysterious symbol  like a prop from Indiana Jones  something discovered on an archaeological dig when land winds sweep in and brush off just enough sand grains from the surface to reveal squiggly impressions that most certainly is an ancient code to a forgotten language of the universe. As you slide the disk into your mouth  you gain the seriousness of a man who is about to turn the key to a secret door that guards so much knowledge.The disk cracks in half  then in quarters  and disintegrates into a sand dune that shifts and spreads across the dark holes of your mouth. Every dribble of saliva secreted by your glands is subsumed by the ultra-absorbent sand  a granular sand that pulls in moisture and induces dust storms.Singularly helpless  look into the gentle eyes of Mei and find a way inside yourself  survival mode  to negotiate the tedium of chewing and swallowing a dry  choking cookie. Think about the time-stillness of your life  in an office that has ravaged your youth  your Joey-Chandler-Ross years: how the quotidian can be so fundamentally cruel.Your colleagues â€” Derrick  Mary  and Mei â€” openly stare at you  their warm morning breaths and neutrally scented  perspiring bodies.â€œHow is it?â€ Mary asks.â€œMm â€ you mumble  pointing to your mouth.â€œHe totally hates your cookies.â€ Derrick snickers. He is wearing those ridiculous sneakers with his potato-colored slacks.â€œThatâ€™s not something to say â€ Mary says in her sing-song voice. She crosses her arms.Mei stands shyly beside the community table where there is a potted fern and a pile of assorted napkins  brown napkins from the Chipotle  white cafeteria-style napkins from the Thai kiosk downstairs  a roll of paper towels  fluffy picnic napkins with hearts and teddy bears.Mei once called you a friend  whereas your definition of friendship is significantly more narrow in scopeâ€”not that you are frugal in your relationships  but this  incidentally  is making you reconsider the terms of your â€œfriendshipâ€ goals.This is why it would not be good to spit out the cookie  not even discretely into a paper napkin  although you are staring at the napkins.â€œHey.â€ Derrick charges at you. He lowers his voice  leaning towards you for a conversation of secrets between men. â€œWhat is it  gross? Should I take one or no?â€You shrug.Mei sees you shrug. Uh  oh.(Whereâ€™d Derrick go?)Meiâ€™s eyes are big and watery  and she forces herself to smile. She had exploded into her soup last month before her trip to China. No one knows why.You want to comfort her but the near-invisible mechanism in your throat  a tiny latch  is being pulled closed  constricting your voice by centimeters as it locks. You can almost visualize how you must look to Mei as you choke  you choke and you smile  eyes watering  like the choking is a joke between two friends  a meta-joke of sorts that acknowledges the polemical minefield you are in.Mary  who gives you this look like you will never be forgiven  has gone on to correct the problem herself. She breaks open a package and shoves the sandy disk into her mouth. Her pleasure is a practiced  lusty chewing that is performed by parents before their children to teach lessons on gratitude.Now cornering Mei  Mary is pressing her to talk about the cultural significance of the cookies  the history of traditional stone-grinding practices of women and children on straw mats beneath sun-baked hutsâ€¦ is she making this stuff up? She half-listens to Mei while waiting for her tea to nuke in the microwave. She pulls out her giant mug and dunks the dirty teabag inside â€” medicinal roots â€” and drives her fingers into the water  pushing down on the teabag. â€œNow  historically  where do they come from  Mei?â€Mei reveals they were not handmade but gotten from a store. The Duty-Free Shop of the Shanghai Pudong International Airport  T2.Maryâ€™s disappointment can be felt by the room. â€œNo tradition?â€Mei shakes her head. Theyâ€™re just her favorite cookies. Delicious cookies. Mei turns to you. â€œRight?â€Looking at Mei  you feel like youâ€™re caught between two stories  knowing hers is a lie.â€œTheyâ€™re alright â€ you say  surprising yourself.Mei  who is somewhat frail but quietly spirited  shrinks back. She claps her neck with her slender fingers  creasing her crisp white Oxford shirt. Her usually cheery voice flies away from her like a runaway balloon.â€œBut Iâ€™m sure there are traditions!â€ Mary blurts out. Mei on the verge of tears.Glancing at the boxes  her eyes welling  Mei starts on the Cultural Revolution  her mother who had died from health complications  a mysterious cancer  the family suspects  related to her grief of separation from her three children  whom she only saw twice a year when they pressed their young faces against a rusted border fence outlining China and not-China territories of a world young Mei intuited was a place of riches â€” migod! Bell-bottom pants and pop records and Coca-Cola and warehouses full of cooking oil. Back then cooking oil was scarce and pork fat was loaded into anything to address severe winters of side-dashing snow storms that seethed over the countryside and made you want to die a gentle sleep  tin canisters were used to store fat drippings  her grandmother used a spatula to skim off curls of hardened lard and used this to supplement anything eatable found in the house. The almond cookies came from this tradition of packing calorie-rich lard into unsweet â€” yes! â€“ bland â€” yes! â€” almond-less â€” yes! â€” but attainable cookies that silvered their lonely  desperate lives. They are cookies she is perpetually homesick for  an innovation born of misery  representing the happiest moments of her life.Your hands get colder and colder and you cannot hear a thing. The fluorescent lights dim over the kitchen  the community kitchen where folks of all colors between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. sit beside one another and leaf through magazines.- - -Tropicanaâ€™s Watermelon (drink with other natural flavors)Submitted by Victoria FombelleIâ€™m what they call a woman of adventure  at least when you consider my experimental juice tendencies. As a pioneer of progress  I couldnâ€™t be happier when I saw an underrepresented fruit finally take the spotlight. Tropicanaâ€™s Watermelon (drink with other natural flavors) spoke to me with a rare kind of seductive intensity. Maybe it was the commanding urgency of this naughtily flirtatious pink bottle that instructed me  in fine print  to â€œdrink with other natural flavors.â€ Before I knew it  I was invited into a realm of flavor exploration and creative license not previously granted to me by other  less daring beverages. Modern Americans live in a land of watered-down soda and crumpled up Crystal Light packets found at the bottom of purses (and murses â€” like I said  Iâ€™m a champion of equality). Iâ€™m not one to stand in the way of destiny  so I gave into the rush of an impulse buy. The adrenaline rushed through my veins  and the numbness of excessive consumerism pervasive in fruit drink culture was replaced by a juice-induced euphoria. I felt so alive!But this was no love at first sip; things got off to a rough start. Iâ€™m not one to be bossed around  so I resented the drinkâ€™s assertions that I USE BY  SHAKE WELL  and PLEASE RECYCLE. Iâ€™ll do whatever the hell I want  Watermelon drink with other natural flavors. This is my moment  and MY America. If we were to forge a bond  I would have none of that domineering Fifty Shades of Pink nonsense. Itâ€™s time for juice drinkers to take back the power.It was all downhill from there. As soon as I learned that this so called â€œnaturalâ€ drink contained only 10% juice  I let my tears flow freely. If the God-forsaken wasteland of Taco Bell can find enough cows overlooked by even the likes of McDonaldâ€™s to muster up 88% beef and theyâ€™re not even allowed to call it beef  then Tropicana needs to up their game. I knew we were entering a dark time in American history  but when Taco Bell presents itself as a moral compass  itâ€™s simply too much for my unbridled spirit to bear.Putting my aesthetic and ethical principles aside  I dried my bitter tears and opened the twist-off cap separating me and the future of 21st century hydration. If you enjoy the sour sting of defeat upon your tongue accompanied with the assurance of dental decay  please  proceed past the first sip. I certainly did. I was â€œlit â€ as the millennials say. My heart ablaze  I wondered how something can simultaneously taste sweet  sour  and soggy. If you cannot find watermelon drink with other flavors at your local juice emporium  a decent alternative would be leaving a handful of pink starbursts out to melt in the sun (paper on) and promptly adding them to watered-down lemonade â€” to taste. I know you wonâ€™t regret it.Some say love is a red  red rose. I say it is a pink  pink drink. But the ecstasy of romance is always accompanied by agony. Questions left unanswered haunted my mind even after the roller-coaster-like emotions of this mind-altering and spiritually awakening experience settled. Am I the first to google â€œsalt in juiceâ€ with sincere confusion and concern in my heart  or am I living in a state of juiceless naivety? Since mainstream American juice culture is dominated by privileged  elitist fruits such as Apple and Grape  did they really need to be included in Watermelonâ€™s first real gig? Talk about cultural appropriation. Grapes get to participate in wine while big-name apples like Granny Smith and Honey Crisp are highly touted and even featured on shows like Keeping Up With The Kardappleins. The scandalous pumpkin  ever since it has been legally recognized as a fruit  knows its place is in the PSL. Why canâ€™t all fruits just stick to their latte in life? Seedy evidence aside  a question of morals comes to mind: how do you juice a watermelon  let alone ethically? These core issues need to be addressed  but until then  I suggest you bask in the sensory glory that is to be offered by Watermelon (drink with other natural flavors). Sure  I may be a dreamer  but for now  Iâ€™ll accept this step in the right direction. Now thatâ€™s something to concentrate on.- - -Trader Joeâ€™s Chocolate Brooklyn BabkaSubmitted by Jaylene ChungIâ€™d recently moved to Los Angeles for a job. Things were new and exciting  and I explored every neighborhood I could  going to strange LA salons and tastings and tours and hosted dinners  in part so I could tell my friends about them later  finishing each story with  â€œIt was soooo LA.â€ I felt great about my agency  and by god  I was really living.But I bet even Oprah has her down days  which is what I told myself when I was feeling alone one Tuesday evening. A work project wasnâ€™t going well  Iâ€™d had a particularly bad Tinder date the day before  and even my own mother wasnâ€™t returning my phone calls. I went home to my very LA loft downtown  and upon opening the fridge  realized that apart from a jar of kimchi and some mustard  I had nothing to eat.And so it was off to Trader Joeâ€™s  where every visit a battle with my wallet. Your maximum spending limit is $40  I told myself sternly. Even Oprah has to practice self-restraint.I did a requisite pass through the cheeses and packaged dinners  even though I was sure I didnâ€™t need anything in that aisle. Unfortunately  Iâ€™d forgotten that the baked goods were also in that section  packaged and stacked on floating tables like gluten-ed and sugared Homerian sirens  and Iâ€™d forgotten to stuff my ears with beeswax.There was one package of Chocolate Brooklyn Babka left in the Cakes Masquerading as Breakfast Items pile  hidden between stacks of cranberry orange scones and blueberry muffins. As I read the label  I thought of a magical weekend Iâ€™d had in New York with friends  where Iâ€™d had chocolate babka that melted in my mouth and stuck to my ribs. And so I threw the Chocolate Brooklyn Babka into my basket  thinking wildly that I could recreate that weekend in my dinner for one.Later  sitting at my kitchen table  I tore off the thick plastic sticker  and not bothering to cut a piece to put on a separate plate  I dug into the sticky  chocolate layers. I took a bite  my teeth sinking into its soft  pillowy denseness. The saccharine of the liberally sprinkled chocolate chips went directly into my bloodstream  and I had another forkful ready before I even swallowed the first bite.I was still eating it  half crouched over the kitchen table  when my roommate came into the kitchen. He is very LA  and is more of a Whole Foods person than a Trader Joeâ€™s person  if you know what I mean. â€œDid you buy a cake for yourself?â€ he asked  the incredulity dripping from his voice as thickly as the slightly gooey swirls of babka clinging to my fork.â€œYes â€ I said defiantly around a mouthful. â€œHappy fucking cake day to myself.â€He shrugged  took a bottle of kombucha from the fridge  and went back into his room.I finished the babka that week. Despite my initial bravado in the face of my roommateâ€™s judgmental glances  I brought it to my room and shut the door each time I ate it  where I could enjoy my sin without rushing.The next week  I was hankering for more; I thought about it at work  at the gym  even while eating other desserts. In between work meetings  I decided to give into the inevitable and stopped at a Trader Joeâ€™s to buy another package. It was my only purchase  and I waited impatiently behind geriatric midday shoppers with cartfuls of greek yogurt  spears of Brussels sprouts  and organic almond butter. I rushed back to my car  where I kept real non-plastic utensils for emergency situations such as this.The relief upon taking that first bite was palpable  and I may have even moaned a little. A woman stared at me as she walked by my car  and I knew what she was thinking. â€œIs that woman really eating a cake out of the package  in her car  in this Trader Joeâ€™s parking lot  in the middle of the workday?â€I glared back her. â€œYes â€ I said telepathically  not breaking eye contact as I chewed. â€œI am.â€It doesnâ€™t taste anything like Brooklyn or homemade babka  but when you have lonely Oprah days in a new city  Trader Joeâ€™s Chocolate Brooklyn Babka is all you need.- - -Califia Farms Classic Cinnamon HorchataSubmitted by Claire ChristoffWhole Foods sells cowâ€™s milkâ€”organic  grass-fed  and hormone-free  of courseâ€”but buying a half-gallon of 2% instead of a box of almond (or rice  or even soy) milk seems hopelessly unhip among the aisles of unbleached tampons and Newmanâ€™s Own dog biscuits.This idea  I recently discovered  can also be applied to the realm of holiday beverages. On my most recent grocery trip  I began to reach for a glass carafe of small-batch eggnog in the dairy section  but I stopped short as soon as I saw it.The bottle.The bottle of Califia Farmsâ€™ Classic Cinnamon Horchata.The beverage that Ezra Koenig praised so earnestly in the 2010 song â€œHorchata.â€Although I hadnâ€™t really listened to Vampire Weekend since high school  I figured I could at least give this â€œcreamy  dreamy sweetnessâ€ a chance. At $4.99 for 48 ounces  it was cheaper than the â€™nog  and I hoped it might carry a little more cachet with the cashier  who ended up being a white guy with dreads.Horchata  according to Wikipedia  originated in Spain as orxata and is typically made from almonds  sesame seeds  rice  barley  or tigernuts. This explained my bottleâ€™s ingredient list  which included three types of nondairy milk (rice  almond  and tigernut) in addition to monk fruit juice concentrate. Monk fruit juice concentrate seems like the kind of thing that Dr. Oz would either love or hate  but I was quick to remind myself that the authority of Dr. Oz is probably not recognized by the alternative-milk community.As soon as I got home  I poured myself a glass and was immediately surprised. Instead of the pleasing cream color for which all those stock photos had prepared me  I was faced with a watery beige  not unlike the waxy chocolate milk of my grade-school days. Despite this unfortunate detail  I swirled the horchata around in my glass  sommelier-style  and took a deep whiff. It smelled like Play-Doh  if Play-Doh were sweetened with monk fruit juice concentrate. Upon taking a sip  I decided that it tasted like the liquid form of a Nutrisystem cinnamon streusel muffin. To be clear  I have never actually eaten a Nutrisystem cinnamon streusel muffin  but sometimes you just have to trust your instincts.(Sadly  my horchata experience was not improved with the addition of alcohol. This may be because the alcohol in question was a clearance bottle of Bacardi Oakheart  which  in my experience  has always paired perfectly with a mug of generic-brand eggnog.)Maybe next year  Iâ€™ll make my own horchata. With Ezra Koenig himself.But probably not.- - -Doritos Loaded Breaded Cheese SnacksSubmitted by James PittThe first thing to keep in mind when handling a Loaded Dorito is that it is dangerous. It is dangerous in exactly the opposite way from a loaded gun.Shall I compare thee to a summerâ€™s day? Only in that you are hot  sticky  and likely to kill the elderly.I expected melted cheese entombed within a carapace of Dorito. I expected that when I bit into it  the shell would crack. Molten bovine extract would boil into my mouth like ichneumon wasps evacuating a crunched tarantula.Instead  I bite into it andâ€¦ into soft cheese. With bread crumbs around it.Imagine  if you can  a Dorito with its character removed. The crunch is marginal. There is surprisingly little flavor. This is the ghost of a Dorito  hardly even crumbs. Hemingway would take a bite and toss it sadly into the sea  dismayed but not surprised at how far the noble Doritoâ€™s might had fallen.Normally I would not criticize breaded cheese. Fried cheese is one of the high works of our civilization  like the spy satellite. It is rarely seen but always out there  providing reassurance on high and terror below.The exact origin of fried cheese is unknown  but it was probably invented by sad-eyed Russo-Jewish men who found their only relief from bleakness in blintzes and physics. Sort of like the spy satellite. Hmm.The point is that Loaded Doritos promise more. They promise to go above and beyond what fried cheese ever could. Specifically: they promise to add crunch  and to make it taste like Doritos.But they are not greaterâ€”they are lesser. This unterjause does not even have the dignity to be greasy! It does not improve  it does not innovate  it does not stand out. No  these are not like the Double Down or the Cronut  bold assaults on the human sense of taste (in both respects). These are dull.Why is the Loaded Dorito dangerous? Because it is no threat. Because it promises excitement  and delivers nothing. It is the Ackmanâ€™s Herbalife lecture of snacks. But this does not mean it is not dangerous. For if you fool yourself into believing it was good  thenâ€”then  you are truly lost! If the Loaded Dorito became popular  our civilization would become as weak and insubstantial as its crumb coating.Loaded Doritos are dust in the wind. They are dust on cheese. Leave them to be forgotten  for they are as ephemeral as this review.- - -Field Roast Classic MeatloafSubmitted by Steven SeighmanMaybe you love your momâ€™s meatloaf  but lately you have a real bug up your ass about how inhumanely cattle are treated in this countryâ€™s vile factory farms. Thatâ€™s where Field Roast comes in! Their vegan products donâ€™t involve feces lakes or weakening antibiotics so that we humans have a harder time fighting off diseases; they just involve a lot of awesome grains â€” no soy! â€” that taste not exactly like your favorite meats  but damn close. The meatloaf is insanely good. Its texture is a little chewier than what you grew up on  and it has carrots in it. But if you bake this bad boy with some ketchup or barbecue sauce on top  your taste buds and tummy wonâ€™t know the difference. Itâ€™s so close youâ€™ll probably be able to trick your gun-toting Republican uncle at the next family get together. And the Field Roast Meatloaf makes for a mean sandwich  too. Itâ€™s as versatile and yummy as the real thing  but doesnâ€™t come with the ghost of a cow that will forever haunt your GI tract. Who needs that?- -Rhythm Superfoods Kool Ranch Kale ChipsSubmitted by JoAnna NovakItâ€™s always compromised circumstances that drive me to Starbucks. My decision to purchase coffee â€œin the world â€ as I say to my husband  is one fraught with all the ethical  moral  aesthetic concerns any conscious consumer today must have â€” right? Should I even spend money on liquid caffeine when I have two modes of producing perfectly drinkable coffee in my dwelling? Should I prioritize an independent coffee purveyor over the convenience of the Starbucks drive-thru  take a circuitous route to honor the little guy? And what if Iâ€™m too lazy to wash my thermos  Iâ€™m short on time  and sleep-deprived? Should I drink the milk at Starbucks when said milk isnâ€™t organic? Should I even drink milk? Should I drink the Sumatra coconut milk at Starbucks  which coconut milk is stabilized with carrageen and who knows what other impurities? Is purity more important or sugar  the sugar that is added to the Sumatra coconut milk at Starbucks? Is sugar worse than dairy?Then thereâ€™s the fact of taste â€” or lack thereof. I met Starbucks as a high school sophomore whose diet consisted of Diet Mountain Dew and whipped cream. So  even though I know they suck  thereâ€™s that part of me â€” sheâ€™s in bubblegum pants and a halter top and her backpack is definitely doing damage to her spine â€” that wants to get stupid and order a frappucino.These days  though  as a whatever adult who thinks about the valence of grams of sugar in her coconut milk  Starbucks has made life easier for me. Thank you  green-aproned baristas across the country  for stocking your pre-counter baskets with thusly-branded healthy snacks. Boutique chocolate from Vosges  packets of spicy seeds sourced from some bougie sounding place in Connecticut  gluten-free pretzel sticks. Then thereâ€™s my favorite: packed inside turquoise and fiery orange bags  along with ample air and a silicon desiccant tablet  kale chips made by Rhythm Superfoods.I know  I know: kale chips are nothing new. A few years ago  I tried some â€” maybe they were supposed to taste like nachos? â€” and nearly gagged on the footishness of the nutritional yeast seasoning. In my own kitchen  with my own salt  I was much happier with big  ripply leaves of the lacinto sometimes called â€œdinosaur kaleâ€ tossed with olive oil  a good sprinkle of fleur de sel.So what drove me to try a bag of Rhythm Superfoods Kool Ranch Kale Chips? Enter Starbucks. I had to be there â€” itâ€™s the only supplier of the chips Iâ€™ve found. And  in fact  I remember the exact day I tried the product: I was stranded in a small town in Massachusetts  whiling away hours â€” like  six â€” between one commitment and another with no place to drop anchor.I had no lunch  no snacks  no coffee â€” just a computer and a wallet. I suppose I couldâ€™ve sat in my car in the back row of a grocery store parking lot or maybe found a busted-spring recliner at the municipal library.But I went to Starbucks.And so I found myself weighing the virtues of Kool Ranch Kale Chips over the possible footish taste. Should I eat the entire bag  I could obtain:12 grams of protein8 grams of fiber110% of my daily value of Vitamin A600% of my daily value of Vitamin K (had I ever ingested that much Vitamin K in my life? the thought made me slaver a little)And all without a lick of nutritional yeast. The poor  sad sandwiches behind the glass case. The poor chocolate grahams (milk and dark) and espresso caramel balls in those weird plastic tubes. How could they ever compete with an organic  vegan  raw  gluten-free  non-GMO super meal for the nutritional steal of 280 calories?One hundred bags later  Iâ€™m here to report Starbucks is now my number one dining destination â€” and Rhythm Superfoods has straight-up mastered the kale chip. I can vouch for both flavors â€” Zesty Nacho and Kool Ranch â€” though I prefer the latter. I still donâ€™t love fake cheese; Iâ€™m neurotic  not a vegan.Neurotic enough to be a bit paranoid about eating these chips in public. Hereâ€™s the kicker. (There had to be one  right? With 600% of your daily value of Vitamin K  something had to give.) That kicker is the integrity of the chips. Unlike the lacinto lovelies I spatula-d off my baking sheet at home  the flavor-crusted chips inside a bag of Rhythm Superfoods Kool Ranch are mostly crumbs  the sort of thing you sometimes see people pouring into their mouth with those lunchbox-sized Doritos. I could never do that. Seriously  it reminded me of an animal dipping its snout in a feed bag. So now I canâ€™t eat my kale chips in public. I mean  really: Iâ€™d have to press a spit-moistened finger into the pile of crumbs and suck away the food â€” who wants to do that at a cramped cafÃ© table? â€” or use a soup spoon or resign myself to throwing away what is surely 450% of the nutritional content.The other day  I stood in line at a Starbucks inside the Barnes and Noble at LAâ€™s Galleria. Compromised circumstances: the air was warm  Iâ€™d just finished a juice greened with spinach  I was still hungry. I scanned for those turquoise or orange bags â€” oh my god  JoAnna  I thought. Get a grip.Obviously  I was waiting to order a venti cup of ice water.There were two college girls behind me in line. â€œLook at all that fucking stuff â€ one said.â€œThose â€ said another  touching the glass in front of a stack of sandy sugar cookies  â€œtheyâ€™re like ridiculous.â€â€œI want a latte  but I shouldnâ€™t â€ one said to the other.â€œDairyâ€™s  like  bad. Not for you â€ said the other girl.Those poor girls  I thought. Satellite Starbucks donâ€™t always stock the same snacks.I ordered my water and sipped hard.- - -Cheese EnsaymadaSubmitted by Alison SatterleeThe package says that itâ€™s a â€œSWEET BRIOCHE WITH CHEESE â€ and perhaps were it actually French  it would qualify as a pastry one could get behind and enjoy eating with a froth-topped coffee drink while wearing a scarf. But no. This is the Chinatown Hostess knockoff of brioche. It looks like a sat-upon sponge cake topped shredded Mexican cheese with worrying white splotches dotting the top.By the time I opened my bleached pastry surprise  the â€œcheeseâ€ had begun to sweat a little in its plastic bag en route from L.A. to Salt Lake City  where we are not worthy enough to have a Filipino bakery. My Filipino friend insisted they were as good as crack  and I believed her because she bought three grocery bags of the stuff and shoved them in her checked bag  purse  laptop bag  and various human orifices just to get them all home. The cheese ones are her favorite  so I bought one greasy little bag and then promptly shoved it in my freezer when I arrived home.In retrospect  I was probably overly concerned about spoilage. Eight out of the ten ingredients were chemicals. I donâ€™t think it actually contained dairy  and even if it did  the detcaifoashthylate would have likely nuked any bacteria present (totally guessing here). I bought it off an unrefrigerated shelf  the pastry itself unnaturally puffy and orange  and it screamed like a siren to my primitive brainstem: â€œI will satisfy your need for salty  sweet  and artery clogging flavors. Each bite of me is 200 calories. You will fucking love me.â€Sadly I was not high or drunk when I ate it  but I was hormonally ravenous. I microwaved one squished ensaymada for about 10 seconds to re-fluff its constitution (as recommended). My friend talked them up like biting into one would grant multiple mouth orgasms  as if some euphoria fairy would crap happiness in my brain. I was ready to regret that I hadnâ€™t been eating these every day for the past 26 years of my existence.Donâ€™t be fooled: these are hamburger buns covered in a moist mat of cheese-food product strings and sugar. And they are fucking delicious.- - -Yogi Womanâ€™s Moon CycleÂ® TeaSubmitted by Kevin DaleyI remember the first time this forbidden potion touched my lips. My boss  Paula  was an older woman experiencing menstrual cramps and asked me to run an errand for her. She gave me a $20 bill and told me to go to Whole Foods  where I would find a box of â€œtea for women.â€ At first  I could not believe that gender binaries had seeped into tea production  but I kept my mouth shut. Halfway down aisle 4  I came across an assortment of teas â€“ chamomile  green  white  ginger spice  and more. I scanned each row looking for womenâ€™s tea and was ready to give up when I finally saw a box that read â€œYogi Womanâ€™s Moon Cycle TeaÂ® â€“ Supports A Healthy Cycle.â€ Then  it dawned on me. Having grown up with only brothers and a Midwestern mother who would never speak of such a topic  I was unaware that such a natural remedy even existed.At checkout  I was greeted by Eddie  a thirty-something burnout with a man bun and tribal tattoos. He scanned the box of tea and then looked at me suspiciously as if I were a minor attempting to buy alcohol with a fake ID. â€œCredit or Debit?â€ I stuttered â€œC-C-Cashâ€ and walked away before he could even hand me a receipt. Back at the office I prepared a cup of the tea for Paula  then secretly made one for myself. I was curious.Ever since that first taste  Iâ€™ve developed a conflicted relationship with Yogi Womanâ€™s Moon Cycle Tea.Â® I drink it daily and wrestle with intense feelings of pleasure  shame  and utter confusion. Is it wrong? Is there any reason a man should not enjoy the sweet ecstasy lying dormant within those tea leaves? What other unknown pleasures await my future? No matter the question  my answer remains the sameâ€¦â€œI just like the taste.â€- - -Sue Ryder Cancer Care Jelly Foam Gingerbread MenSubmitted by Jacob AndrewsOur lives have become so safe we seek out pain.Look at the cult that has arisen on YouTube of people â€œreviewingâ€ terrible movies and video games. There are plenty of atrocious clips to gawk at  and of course  inspired by this  viewers seek out the actual movies to submerge themselves in the awfulness.An equivalent for food exists as well  usually centered around really hot chilies  raw spices  or foreign oddities with ingredients or flavor combinations bizarre to the western palate.It is this you must remember when  while browsing in a London charity shop  I saw the bags of gingerbread-man shaped and colored gummies and my immediate thought was. â€œOh God. Those look horrible. I have to inflict them on my family.â€Shared experiences â€“ even negative â€“ are bonding experiences after all; and I guess that shared experience with my family  however brief  must have been something I desired at the time. The reason I was in the charity shop  and the reason it was a charity shop in London  was that I was early for a room viewing and was killing time. I was moving out.And if the gummies were so bad half of them got thrown away  fuck it  the money was going to charity. I doubt I would have been so spendthrift otherwise.Upon returning home and revealing my purchase to my family  we discovered that the Jelly Foam Gingerbread Men were not even ginger(bread) flavored  but were â€œCookies and cream flavor.â€This was a slight let-down but also exciting â€“ a strong  sweet ginger flavor might have been able to mask any disagreeable taste and perhaps even overcome the unusual gummy texture it had been paired with and creep over the line to pleasant.That would have been disappointing.The time came. They certainly smelled like cookies and flavor â€“ if you did whatever the olfactory equivalent of squinting is. Anticipating my disgust with something close to perversion  I enthusiastically chomped the head off  as all sane people feel compelled to do when presented with anthropomorphic food.The taste is best described as that of a mild medical adhesive. The texture of the â€œcreamâ€ part of the sweet was slightly chalkier than I imagine most consumers would care for. I was disappointed. I could easily finish the rest of the decapitated gummy. I could probably  over time  work my way through the rest of the bag on my own if I had to. These were neither pleasant nor cathartically vile. It almost feels an insult to the swine and kine who made up the gelatin that their extremities have been wasted on these.Taken separately the layers are little better and  more disappointingly  a little worse. The brown  not-gingerbread layer tastes of lies and a mild and artificial almost-caramel-but-not-quite sweetness. The chalky â€œcreamâ€ layer  alkaline yet floral  reveals itself to be where the pharmaceutical element comes from; and taken alone at times the stiff  powdery texture makes me microshudder  in a minor nails-down-the-blackboard way.My familyâ€™s reaction was reviled yet muted. No one wanted another  and my mother wouldnâ€™t finish her first  but her reaction was only enough to raise a small chuckle. Everyone agreed that they are not nice  but not foul enough to inspire any strong feelings. It was established that I actually mind them the least. And as that was the case and I bought them it was down to me to finish them  despite the fact that I didnâ€™t actually enjoy them. But Iâ€™d spent money on them so they were gonna get eaten whether I like it or not. Itâ€™d be a waste of money and further insult to the contributing livestock otherwise.At first  my zeal in this task was admirable. I even grew to slightly enjoy eating them. Not for the taste mind  but from a kind of satisfaction that I was being a good  thrifty boy and my Sisyphean willpower was overcoming this unpleasant task and avoiding wasting both money and food.Then the move got in the way.Now  near three months later and staring at the remaining gummy breadmen  I realize I must take up this task once again.The smell is the same as ever. I had forgotten it in the intervening months but its chemical buttermilk mien waltzes right out of that little plastic sack demanding our unfinished business be seen to. The brown front layer remains as malleable as ever  but has bled into the white backing layer  which itself has hardened significantly  as if the chalk is returning to its natural state.Theyâ€™re chewier. They taste basically the same  yet worse than I remember. I imagine itâ€™s just that the tolerance I built up has worn off. Iâ€™m not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed â€“ on the one hand I can finish the bag and my task; I will not have failed. On the other  thereâ€™s now no excuse not to finish the damn things.All told  the gummies were disappointing as a family bonding experience. Not nearly disgusting enough to be brought up and reminisced about how I wasted money on them. I almost regret giving the Â£2 to cancer care.- - -Brooklyn Kolache Co.â€™s King RollSubmitted by Sylvia IrizarryI think of the beginning of a new year as a time to deprive yourself of all things that fall in the â€œgood but bad for youâ€ category. Naturally  upon entering the bakery  my eyes transfixed on a gaudy roll I was sure tasted as dangerous as it looked. Rows of gold  green  and purple sprinkles nestled in a sweet-cheese frosting beckoned me in a similar fashion that New Orleans did  so many years ago.Now Iâ€™ve seen bits of Girls Gone Wild: Best of Mardi Gras (just like any self-respecting researcher) and Iâ€™ve vacationed in Disneyâ€™s Port Orleans Resort  but neither prepared me for the unbridled bliss I was yet to experience. Donned in Mardi Gras throws (most of which I purchased beforehand lest I be labeled anything less than Goddess of the Gras) I followed the Krewe of Bosom Buddies along their parade route and exuded the aura of the most prepossessing peacock  or at least thatâ€™s what I envisioned. I wanted the world to see the transformation I had undergone since I stepped off the plane  not but three hours earlier. I felt the city coursing through my veins  certain to be the latest victim to succumb to its devices.Sinful; indulgent; much like the Big Easy itself. Akin to a bad relationship where the present bliss outweighs the inevitable pain  but I like pain and this has a little more cinnamon. Anyway  the king roll was pretty good.- - -Taste Of Nature Coconut Granola BarSubmitted by Karley JohnsonWhen I asked my mom for something healthy for my lunches I didnâ€™t expect her to follow through. Her load from Costco usually included sugary fruit snacks  frozen waffles  and various other things of similar health levels.I was perfectly happy enjoying bulk quantities of junk until I noticed a box of Taste Of Nature Granola Bars nestled in the back of our pantry. The box held three kinds of bars: Brazil nut  cranberry  and coconut. Considering my options was easy; I didnâ€™t know what a Brazil nut was and I hated cranberries  so naturally I went for a coconut one. The wrapper was a lovely turquoise color  and had six labels on it: organic  gluten-free  non-GMO  vegan  and â€˜Uâ€™. Iâ€™m still not sure what that last one was.I was hesitant  this thing was probably the healthiest thing I would ever consume  but I opened it anyways. The scent of coconut filled the air  and there seemed to be something layered under it  like lemon disinfectant. When I bit into it the first thing I thought was that it had the consistency of Rice Krispie squares  but with many seeds. Whatever was holding it together was sticky and clung to my hands. It tasted more like coconut and less like trail mix â€” minus the M&Mâ€™s â€” than I expected. It even had whole almonds! This thing was good  and healthy for me!About halfway through the bar my excitement started wearing off. The sweetness overpowered my mouth  tasting less like a bounty of naturally good flavors and more like I was drinking vanilla extract. I had the terrible urge to drink liters upon liters of water  but I carried on.When the last bite was swallowed  I was left feeling like I had eaten a coconut-covered shoe. I had learned a valuable lesson: there is such a thing as too much coconut  regardless of how healthy it is.- - -Green Maraschino Cherries Submitted by Amy BarnesMy husband once made an off-hand positive reference to a maraschino cherry topping his milkshake. Ergo  every Christmas  he gets a keg-sized jar of maraschino cherries from my warehouse-club-loving mom. Recently  I was watching Food Networkâ€™s Chopped and saw a food item that struck fear in my heart for future holidays: GREEN maraschino cherries.I hoped these cherries were the Ted Allen version of maraschino cherries  destined for a fruit-filled cocktail. But it was not to be. The chefs manipulated those green cherries into sauces for chicken and pork and a â€œvinaigretteâ€ for authentically green lettuce. I swore I saw a chef taste one and puke behind his station.My house is not the Chopped kitchen and our cherry usage is usually relegated to desserts or the occasional sticky-fingered jar grab at midnight. I could only imagine the green dye and sugar involved in creating these seemingly radioactive cherries. Before my mom could procure an industrial-size jar of the juicy boogers  I got a small gourmet-size jar to see how the other half of the maraschino cherries lived. Next to the standard red cherries from Christmas â€˜08  it was like a two-pack of NyQuil â€” both nasty flavors but without any medicinal qualities  or the mind-numbing alcohol content.As I used my wedding pickle fork in the mini jar of green orbs  the obligatory sticky syrup swirled like a tide pool or Ninja Turtle cesspool (I wasnâ€™t sure which). I put the stem-less green fruit in my mouth wondering if I would turn into the Incredible Hulk from the obviously modified scientific oddity in my mouth.Instead  it was as if I had inhaled the taste of a thousand green cherry Icee drinks. My teeth  tongue  and mouth felt and looked green. I was momentarily tempted to drink a little of the green liquid like during late night coughing fit trip to the medicine cabinet. I needed to hide this contraband toxic waste from warehouse club buyers and my mother. My sugar rush allowed me to utter the only three appropriate words for green maraschino cherries in my green-tinged reality host voice: You Are Chopped.- - -McClureâ€™s Garlic Dill Pickles Submitted by Jenna SteckelThese are the Bentleys of the pickle world: refined styling  outlandishly expensive  and ultimately disappointing (if Bentleys are  in fact  ultimately disappointing; the only ride Iâ€™ve taken in one  I was thirteen and seated on a friendâ€™s lap  so to me  yeah  a bit of a letdown). I admired them from afar for months  eyeing them in their tasteful neo-rustic packaging and Spicy and Garlic Dill varieties. I had a nagging suspicion that perhaps that I could Get What I Paid For and buy for the low  low price of $10 a jar of pickles so good theyâ€™d be deserving of the obvious sex jokes Iâ€™m too refined to make here.One day finally I decided  â€œIâ€™m good enough  Iâ€™m smart enough  and doggone it  Iâ€™m generally conservative enough with my financesâ€ and bought the damn things. I tried to seek out the most packed pickle jar (when buying the Cream de La Mer of pickles  one wants as many ounces of vinegary wrinkle-be-gone as one can get). I chose Garlic Dill over Spicy  as getting a rarer flavor to judge against the rest seemed the pickle equivalent of a college admissions office comparing a kid from a public magnet school with one who â€œhappensâ€ to have the same last name as the campus library.I joked a bit with the cashier about my even purchasing these things (though they were rightfully the real comedians  setting me up like this by selling a $10 jar of pickles). There was an absurdist quality to buying in pickles the equivalent of two weeksâ€™ wages in many countries  because how could I make a purchase like this with a straight face? My only condolences were that I was doing this for Science (hardly) and that  knowing myself  this jar would be my dinner and people do spend $10 on dinner without batting an eye. Theyâ€™re just getting something besides briny cucumbers  usually.I took them home  the mason jar a vial for what one has to assume was a brining agent comprised of the Russian royal familyâ€™s tears; vinegar turned from the wine the Church first declared Jesusâ€™s transubstantiated blood; a clove of garlic already successful in warding off a real vampire; the salt Gandhi himself picked up during the Salt March; and ordinary dill  because nothing famous has ever happened with dill.I ritually unscrewed the lid. Inside  floating languidly like the dauphines they were  the champagne of pickles sent out a garlicky scent emissary. I plucked out a tender Eloi to feed on.But as class warriors depict â€œfat catsâ€ as literally so  these pampered pickles had grown soft   plump and acquiescing to my chomp without the scrappiness youâ€™d expect their Detroit/Brooklyn provenance to have imparted on them. One does not turn to pickles for a good chew  however. One seeks out a pickle to crunch.So texture was that of stale Play-Doh  but taste? Surely they would have the brisk  crisp taste of a ten dollar bill  tasting brightly of freedom and capitalism and salted by the perspiration of the many hands by which it had been exchanged  making this country great? That would save the experience  no? But the pickles turned out to taste of an almost smoky musk  pickle-esque but veering considerably from the typical brine. Iâ€™ll admit  I was a bit anxious upon seeing no default  classic pickle option among the Spicy and the Garlic Dill  and I had wondered why they thought they were too good for the flavor â€œpickle â€ but here was proof that McClureâ€™s was truly Doing Its Own Thing  making pickles with the give of a good bread and the taste of a smokehouse workerâ€™s kerchief.Alas  I had not found the One True Pickle. To be completely candid  however  that came as a relief. Going in  I was afraid I would find in this $10 jar the Golden Ratio of pickles and be haunted ever after by the knowledge I had let true love slip out of my too-plebeian grip. At least now I could go back to those bargain $7 pickle jars  confident in what I wasnâ€™t missing.- - -Doritos Royal â€˜Koubashiâ€™ Burnt Butter DoritosSubmitted by Liby HaysI at first was unsure why these run-of-the-mill Japanese noms seemed so fascinatingly uncanny. Butter flavor in a corn product is nothing revolutionary. But I was shocked at the idea that they were supposed to taste burnt. Itâ€™s rare for a snack product to reference its style of preparation  besides the ubiquitous â€œkettle-cookedâ€ (which refers to the cooking vessel). But itâ€™s even rarer for a snack food to make any reference to burning  the state of being over-cooked  because this would suggest a set cooking timeframe. Snacks  in the classical understanding  exist outside of conventional notions of time. They do not perish in accordance with normal laws of organic decay because they belong to the parallel sphere of mythic snack-time. The slogan of Frito-Lay Japan  â€œPop Your Time â€ is a testament to this. This phrase seems to suggest that snack-time is like a pustule  welling up with internal pressure until it must open onto our world in a grand  exultant burst. Indeed  when I placed the Dorito on my tongue it was a near-orgasmic sensation. My enzymatic saliva worked to disclose an entire history of flavor- from the discovery of sweetness  of honeyed pleasure beyond pleasure to a saltiness of oceanic scale to creamy resplendence to a Promethean touch of umami  whisked by dancing flames. The Doritos are part of the â€œRoyalâ€ chips line which includes other savory facsimiles like â€œTandoori Chicken â€ â€œGarlic Shrimp â€ and â€œBeef Consomme.â€ Their shape is also distinctive  with one rounded corner and two straight ones  simultaneously suggesting a royal hierarchy or referencing the shape of the crown.

The gummy soda â€” like the gummy burgers  fries  hot dog  and pizza â€” must be eaten to ensure maximum taste bud stimulation.  If a child  non-progressive adolescent  or wide-eyed curious adult were to attempt to drink the gummy soda  they would not succeed.In most cases  the Lunch Bag consumer recognizes the gummy sodaâ€™s ingestion requirements.In rare cases  the Lunch Bag consumer does not recognize the gummy sodaâ€™s ingestion requirements  and subsequently taps on their guardianâ€™s shoulder â€” or  tugs on their guardianâ€™s jacket or loose-fitting shirt â€” to inquire about proper gummy soda ingestion techniques.  Wide-eyed curious adults  of course  tap on the shoulder of â€” or  tug on the jacket or loose-fitting shirt belonging to â€” the person nearest them.It is hypothesized that in extreme cases of Lunch Bag gummy soda ingestion stalemates  the consumer becomes outraged once informed of the gummy sodaâ€™s â€œdemandingâ€ ingestion requirements  which include the exertion of extra physical effort in order to chew the solid gummy with the mouth.It is also hypothesized that  on occasion  a gummy soda consumer will ask for a refill.Overall  the eFrutti Lunch Bag serves its purpose  which is undoubtedly to pique the interest of gummy-loving children and adolescents who have a high success rate in the field of impulse candy hustling.The eFrutti Lunch Bag is not recommended for wide-eyed curious adult ingestion  although a once in a lifetime Lunch Bag experience is permissible.Please be sure to make a special note in your nutrition journal that the eFrutti Lunch Bag is most certainly not intended  under any circumstances  to be an adequate substitute for real food.- - -Peanut Brittle CheesecakeSubmitted by Eva Lisa ElasigueShe swallowed and sighed  then couldnâ€™t stop laughing and forgot how to use a chair.  This was the result of the peanut brittle cheesecake.I cannot finish the last bite before recording it.  But describing the dessert by its ingredients seems reductively crude.  I flop back in my chair.  It is impossible.It included: mint  one leaf; two thin slices of bananas foster  with a complete caramelized crust that I broke with my fork like ice on a pond; banana sugar syrup oozing between the cracks; a dollop of whipped cream  just a teaspoon; scattered teeny semi-sweet chocolate chips; and peanuts.I hesitate to finish describing it because as a whole it is inimitable â€” if someone were to attempt a reproduction from my account  and somehow miss the magical key to this creation  I would be very sad  and not want it.But that too  is impossible.  See  they make their own peanut brittle  and itâ€™s like  the soft kind?  And then they involve it with the cheesecake â€” yes they  the magical dessert elves from inside the tree.  It is super involved.  And then  thereâ€™s a light crusting of granulatedâ€¦ baking chocolate.It started off cool  and by the time I picked up the last bite with my fingers â€” part of the mint leaf sitting on it like a hat â€” I almost couldnâ€™t.This is the story of the peanut brittle cheesecake.|1009|Thatâ€™s right  playwright!

It was J  my closest friend dating back to kindergarten. As only children  weâ€™re more like sisters than friends. She told me her elderly mother had suddenly died  and the funeral was in two days in New York. There was no doubt in my mind â€” I cut my New Orleans trip short  flew home to Oregon  and then headed back to the airport to get a flight to La Guardia. I wrote a eulogy on the plane and took a cab from the airport to the funeral home  arriving shortly before the service started.Jâ€™s mother  A  had always been a collector. When I was about 12 years old  A made me promise that when the time came  I would help J go through her apartment  so that none of her collections â€” paperweights  snuffboxes  paintings â€” would be overlooked. As it turned out  A had become a hoarder in her later years. The beautiful paperweights were still arranged just so in the china cupboard  but the apartment on the other side of the glass had descended into chaos. J and I arrived to find rooms crammed with history and junk and art and garbage and collectibles. Treasures were liberally sprinkled amidst the trash  so every item had to be examined. It was a hugely emotional process for us both  reinforcing our sisterhood.In a bedroom drawer  under a sea of stained takeout menus  letters from the 1930s  unopened Con Ed bills  and old photos  I noticed a crinkled silver whistle  something A had picked up years ago during a trip to Mexico. Handmade  with a gold head and an interesting shape  it played a loud  crisp note  and I loved the feel of it in my hand. J offered it to me  and I put it on my key ring.In the four years since then  I have used it many times (once to get the attention of Oregon tourists who were exploring offshore rocks and were oblivious to the incoming tide). My kids think it looks like a ramâ€™s horn  but they are wrong. I know it is a shrimp â€” one of A and Jâ€™s favorite foods  and the ghost in New Orleans that allowed the call to come through and said  â€œPut down that jambalaya. Your sister needs you back East.â€|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 11|Dear Human Resources Department I would like to submit my name for consideration for the position of Rent-Seeking Capitalist at your firm. Although this position is not listed on your website  I want to inquire about any openings that may be available in the future. I believe my experience and passion uniquely qualify me for this role.As you can see from my CV  I spent four years in a corporate analyst position at a leading financial services company. In this role  I worked hard to complete the work delegated to me from higher levels of management  maintaining a positive attitude even when confronted with repetitive and boring tasks. Although I am grateful for the learning opportunities and mentorship I received  I am ready to shift direction toward something that will allow me to work less but make more money. Becoming a rent-seeking capitalist at your firm would be a great fit for me at this stage of my career.In fact  I recently took a â€œWhat Career Best Suits You?â€ quiz on the reputable website Buzzfeed  and the result was unequivocal: I am best suited to own the means of production.The process of commodifying my labor and selling it on the market for a low fixed wage has its appeal  but I believe I will be able to benefit more by exploiting the labor of others. I take my commitment to the bottom line over any and all human concerns seriously  and will work hard to use the fullest extent of the law to minimize my tax burden. The taxpayers of America should be paying me  not the other way around.My passion for this position was inspired by my undergraduate coursework in Marxist theory  particularly the classes I took about the masterwork Das Kapital. The way that Marx describes those do-nothing rent-seeking capitalists struck me at my core: I knew immediately that I wanted to be one of them. The workers of the world will eventually overthrow the capitalist class in a great Proletarian Revolution  but until that day I would definitely like to be on the side of the capitalists.I have heard the claims from other capitalists  especially before political contests  that the capitalist class is being unfairly targeted. I am ready to yell louder and more angrily about the injustice of the capitalist system toward capitalists. We must stay strong  together. If you take a chance on me  I will never let the capitalist class down.If there are still no openings for the position of Rent-Seeking Capitalist  please consider my application for Program Assistant  as listed on your website. I have a lot of bills to pay.Sincerely Josh FreedmanFuture Capitalist|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              12|My God  can you believe Donald Trump did that thing?! It was despicable! It was offensive! I am furious! I am saddened! I could barely stand to watch the video. But I did watch itâ€¦ about 400 times (So many pre-roll ads for antacid!) getting more and more outraged with each successive viewing.Seriously  how horrible was that thing Donald Trump did? Normal people do not act like this! Itâ€™s not cute or funny anymore! He is lowering the bar! He is coarsening the discourse! Heâ€™s a fraud! Heâ€™s a bigot! Heâ€™s a misogynist! Is this the thing he does that finally turns his own party against him? It HAS to be  right? I bet it is! Iâ€™m going to engage with a social media platform that mines my personal data (So many banner ads for antidepressants!) to say just that. Andâ€¦ done! Now my friends know EXACTLY what I think (Even though none of them are planning to vote for Donald Trump  nor have they ever met or seen anyone who is planning to vote for Donald Trump.)Look  say what you will about Mitt Romney  he would not have done that thing that Donald Trump did. Sure  he might have done other  more boring things  but not that thing. No sir. That thing was simply the worst. Simply. The. Worst. Period!HAVE I MENTIONED THAT I AM SICKENED AND ANGERED BY THAT THING THAT DONALD TRUMP DID!â€¦ Sorry  Iâ€™m getting so worked up just thinking about it. I need to see how everyone else is reacting to that thing Donald Trump did  so Iâ€™m refreshing a popular news site over and over again (So many pop-up ads for Canadian immigration attorneys!)Ah  good! The people I like are shocked and appalled by that thing Donald Trump did. Whew! Thatâ€™s a relief.  At least there is still some shred of sanity and decency in the â€” wait  the people I donâ€™t like are saying that thing Donald Trump did wasâ€¦ good?!NO  NO  NO  NO  NO! It wasnâ€™t good! It was heartless and retrograde and grammatically incorrect on countless levels! How can you be so blind? Our republic is fragile and that thing Donald Trump did could be the very thing that destroys it! My heart is racing! I feel sick! I need some antacid! I must immediately check the famous poll aggregator that everyone relies on to stay sane during election yearsâ€¦AAAAGH! WHAT?! The polls are way  way closer than they should be! Analysts are saying the thing could actually help him with certain key demographics! Apparently  elderly voters in rural Ohio LOVE that awful thing Donald Trump did! But  why? WHY?! Maybe if I buy this guyâ€™s book Iâ€™ll understand the concept of â€œmargin of errorâ€! Okayâ€¦ done. Should be here in 3-4 business days.While I wait  I have time to reflect again on that thing that Donald Trump did (I hated it.) Truly  the only good that will come from that thing (which was horrible) is that it will be great fodder for my favorite comedian who was given a TV show by a huge multinational media conglomerate hoping to make money. I canâ€™t wait to see my favorite comedian absolutely DESTROY Donald Trump in a LEGENDARY EPIC TAKEDOWN for that crappy thing that he did! Let me just sit through one more pre-roll ad (for relaxed-fit pleated khakis) so I can watch it on the video streaming service owned by the monolithic search engine companyâ€¦Wow. My favorite comedian really cut to the very heart of that thing Donald Trump did and showed how much it truly sucked ass. That segment was cathartic and satisfying and perhaps the power of laughter can heal ourâ€”OH MY GOD  Donald Trump did a new thing! Itâ€™s all over the news! HE DID A NEW THING!

As you may recall from our briefing in July  the standard size of six-inch and footlong Subway sandwiches are damning sources of scale. A photo of our candidate holding one of these sandwiches would provide concrete evidence to the claim his hands resemble those of an eleven year-old boyâ€™s.So far weâ€™ve done a great job of avoiding photo ops involving Subway. We can all recall times Mr. Trump has sent us to order his beloved Italian BMT on Italian Herbs & Cheese Subway sandwich. I donâ€™t need to remind you that photographic proof of our next president holding this sandwich would not only highlight his petite  non-presidential hands  but also his love for â€œethnicâ€ sandwiches  which wouldnâ€™t sit well with our base.Letâ€™s not rest on our laurels â€” surely  the media will soon connect the dots. Whether they find Trump eating Subway or not  Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll ask for comment. In case Trumpâ€™s explicit avoidance of Subway is dredged up by the media  Iâ€™ve compiled talking points to deflect any possible questions or critiques we may encounter.1. Subway is just as unhealthy as McDonaldâ€™s.In preparation for Trumpâ€™s eight-year stay in the White House  heâ€™s been following a healthy diet. One of the best diets. If needed  his doctor will provide a note proving this. This is the reason you wonâ€™t find Trump eating Subway. It has nothing to do with the sandwich providing scale and highlighting his less-than-average hand size.If the media suggests this is an invalid claim  as Trump has been photographed eating food even more unhealthy than Subway  refer to Talking Point 2.2. Subwayâ€™s bread contains Azodicarbonamide  the same chemical used to make yoga mats.Donald Trump will not eat anything that is also used to make yoga mats. Trump has never practiced yoga  an Indian ritual  ever in his life. If they want to see a politician get into a pretzel-shape  ask Hillary Clinton about her email! Absolutely no reason that Trump would be scared to hold a Subway sandwich because his hands would look diminutive in comparison.If the media points out Subwayâ€™s bread no longer contains Azodicarbonamide  refer to Talking Point 3.3. Mr. Trump prefers to support local businesses.A salt-of-the-Earth man like Trump does not eat at huge corporations like Subway. He eats at the same places Joe Everyman eats. Use this opportunity to plug a local business  claim that Donald loves to eat there. (Note: Cheryl  PLEASE check that the restaurant you plug is not a chain. How have you not heard of Bertucciâ€™s?) This is a more than sufficient reason to avoid Subway â€” it has nothing to do with Trumpâ€™s hands looking small while holding a Subway sandwich  and claiming otherwise is simply absurd.If the media identify photos of Donald consuming large corporate fast-food products such as McDonaldâ€™s and KFC  refer to Talking Point 4.4. Mr. Trump will not associate with losers like Jared Fogle.Our next president will not be associated with convicted sex offender and former Subway spokesman  Jared Fogle  in any way. Donald Trump is our only presidential candidate of character  and values â€” values that do not align with Jared Fogle. (Do not mention the fact Jared Fogle has endorsed Trump  as this is not a sought-after endorsement.) Trump will not compromise his character for a sandwich â€” a sandwich that may very well be delicious â€” we have no idea. Trump would gladly hold a Subway sandwich in his hands  if he had a good reason to. But he doesnâ€™t. So he wonâ€™t. End of story.If the media points out this defense is invalid  and frankly unfair  since Jared Fogle is in no way associated with Subway anymore  refer to Talking Point 5.5. Subway is losing money.By this time  I hope this point is self-explanatory. Follow the game plan. Get on the offensive: Subway has been making very bad deals. Claim youâ€™ve seen their numbers  and they are very bad. Not losing-916-million-dollars-in-one-year bad (by the by  NEVER use the number 916 million â€” no matter what the context) but bad all the same. Do not explain which numbers  or why theyâ€™re bad. But confirm  theyâ€™re the worst numbers youâ€™ve ever seen. Itâ€™s very sad  actually. You think a winner  co-author of The Art of the Deal  would actually eat at Subway? This has nothing to do with hand size. It never did. Trumpâ€™s hands are completely normal-sized  and weâ€™ll bring anyone to court who says otherwise.If youâ€™ve exhausted all of these points to no avail  make a remark about Trumpâ€™s daughter. Make it unclear if she is an object of Trumpâ€™s fatherly affection or something else. While the press look at each other quizzically  tersely conclude the meeting and exit the room. Itâ€™s much better to end on these puzzling terms than to expose the truth.Make America Great Again Steve|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         14|Soon to be upon us is the fateful day the prophecy has foretold.For it is written: In the tenth month of the sixteenth year of the third millennium  when the wrathful punitive goat-kind have finally forgiven the people of northeastern Illinois their sins  the Chicago Cubs will win the World Series  and thus the divine prophecy shall be fulfilled.The poor and naÃ¯ve who fail to heed this warning and observe the signs  contented in their ever-affirmed denial  shall be the first to crumble with the city when the Cubbies take it all.For in the many moons leading up to the day  the bandwagon overfloweth  and the prophecy states that the Cubsâ€™ steadfast supporters  barely subdued for 108 years by perpetual loss  shall rise up in victory to overtake the city when the series is won. Freed at last from their purgatory of unrewarded fandom  they shall unleash upon the city a hell-on-earth yet to be witnessed.And on the day they shall fill the streets  spreading violently from their wretched Wrigleyville epicenter like a thick splotch of red and blue ink oozing across the page  destroying everything in its path. And they shall claim the city.For weeks the unsuspecting metropolis will be ravaged by the thick-necked  soft-handed followers cloaked in their red and vomit-stained royal blue  the streets awash with urine and Natty Light from Rogers Park to Chinatown.Together in arms  these supporters shall make public transportation a thing of the past as thousands of innocents attempt to flee too late. The devastation of any ill-maintained structures in the way of their victorious rampage shall exceed hundreds of landlordsâ€™ abilities to get it taken care of.Whispers of 2003 shall be brutally stifled. And it is foretold that TV programming will be hijacked for lands away  and requests for â€œGo Cubs Goâ€ shall drown out all the rest. No visible window shall stand free of a hanging â€˜Wâ€™ pennant  as no â€˜Wâ€™ shall stand for anything but long-awaited victory. Not anything but.And the city shall burn to the ground as a new era is violently ushered in.All this has been foretold. All this is what shall come to pass this tenth month of the sixteenth year of the third millennium.But twenty percent shall be taken off the bill of any soul who displays a Chicago Cubs ticket at participating Chicagoland Red Robins  for the prophecy also states that it is not all bad.This is the Cubbiesâ€™ year.

Writing is serious business. The most serious of all the businesses. Iâ€™m always on call. At any given moment  someone could need some words and you know what Iâ€™ll do? Iâ€™ll write them some words. You must have all of the best words if you want to be a good writer. It might seem like Iâ€™m just lying on the couch  eating string cheese  and watching Dr. Phil with my cat  but in reality every second of my life is spent on high alert  searching for newer and better words. Like boondoggle and yonic and maritime. To be a truly great writer  one must spend every waking (and sleeping  eating  bathing  etc.) moment surrounded by words in hopes of absorbing them through word-osmosis. This makes the lifestyle extremely treacherous. True  my ability to precariously stack books and papers is impressive  but Iâ€™m under constant threat of being crushed to death by a periodical avalanche. I could easily become just another writing fatality. What happens if I canâ€™t remember the word â€œcloche?â€ And what if  in my frustration  I gesture so dramatically that suddenly everything is collapsing around me?

Many men assume that a woman would only forgo a headphone jack by choice. But  with the technological landscape being so complex  it can be easy for a woman to get overwhelmed when making decisions about her headphones.Maybe itâ€™s been so long since sheâ€™s used headphones with a jack that sheâ€™s forgotten how much more reliable the sound quality can be. Or maybe when buying the headphones  she was unaware that corded headphones are still widely available on the market. Whatever her reasons  you want to be sure she sees what sheâ€™s missing out on and give her the chance to downgrade. To do this  you will need to overcome a few obstacles.First  because her sense of sound is already occupied  youâ€™ll have to resort to visual means to get her attention. In my experience  the best way to achieve this is to throw something in her line of sight. I tend to rely on whateverâ€™s close at hand  such as a small pebble  a lit cigarette  or some broken glass. It doesnâ€™t really matter  as long as it gives her the opportunity to notice you and your oversized  corded headphones plugged into a jack.Once you have her attention  she is likely to remove her headphones  allowing you a window to begin a conversation with her. A good way to lead is to say  â€œExcuse me  are you aware that youâ€™re using wireless headphones? Donâ€™t you miss having a cord?â€ or â€œYou seem to have lost the cord to your headphones. Would you like to use my headphones instead?â€ Make sure as youâ€™re speaking to her that your corded headphones are in plain view so she can see what sheâ€™s missing before she answers. She may have left the house that morning convinced that she does not need or want a headphone jack  but with one look at yours  she will probably begin to have second thoughts.If she seems quiet  donâ€™t mistake her shyness for disinterest. Keep the conversation going by suggesting some brands of headphone jacks she might enjoy instead. Offer to help her buy some new headphones  in the event that her dad is too busy to help her.If she still seems steadfast in her loyalty to wireless headphones  point out to her how likely she is to lose one of them  and how hard it will be to find. Just because the wireless headphones are white  doesnâ€™t mean sheâ€™ll be able to see them easily. What if she drops them in a snowstorm or on the tile floor of a ladiesâ€™ sauna? Boy  will she ever be sorry then.Finally  if sheâ€™s still unconvinced by your confidence  ask if sheâ€™s prepared to spend the rest of her life locked into corporate technological dependence. Be forewarned  this is the Hail Mary of pickup lines  and very few women will be able resist you at this point. But if she does  youâ€™re probably better off.

My body filled with an overwhelming feeling. From that point forward I knew I had to do good things for other people and not for myself.Thatâ€™s when I knew you  Sarah Lawrence  were right for me  my darling.Some of my qualifications are: service  leadership  watched kissing videos on Youtube  academics  play cello  older brother who told me what girls like and how to apply deodorant  Spanish  SAT scores  decent text-er  sports  allowance from chores for buying flowers or a little plastic ring  Boy Scout  sportsmanship when playing sports  flexible curfew if chores are done so we can spend time together and maybe go to a movie  teacher who likes me enough to not write bad recommendation  car to drive to you  ACT  and poetry.But  during my life  it is not my many  many accomplishments (all done simultaneously) that have defined my ability to be MERITOUS as your boyfriend. It has been my failures. And the humble way I have learned weighty lessons from them. There are MULTITUDINOUS examples.Firstly  during a summer I went to Mexico with my church group and BEQUEATHED and VOUCHSAFED houses to people there. In the sweaty sun I built not just a house  but a home. Additionally  I built a spot in my heart for people  all over the world  especially those who look different or have less money than myself  like you  baby.I came away with an even larger dedication to hard work  family  and DOGGEDNESS. But  I did fail to save them from poverty. That still gnaws at me. I knew I could do more to make sure I had a concrete success in the wake of failure. So  arriving back in the United States  I decided to fail and then succeed at having a school Saxophone Club.We began small  but now are soaring like a CACOPHONOUS crescendo of notes! I think my own story is like these notes  and ours could be too. In some ways  the crescendo of a saxophone is a metaphor that can carry my entire story: starting low and ending high  beginning from the bottom (my many failures) to my success (Saxophone Club!). The crescendo could be metaphor for us  in my example  too.Therefore  we seem to fit well together well. My dad dated a Sarah Lawrence at his age. As did my aunt. I value this tradition and hope to join it.After receiving a tour (May 12th)  I am even more confident I would make a good fit. You showed me around your rec room  which is best suited for â€œjust  I donâ€™t know  having fun.â€ I can do that and often do have fun with such people as Mr. Crosby (whose letter of recommendation you will find enclosed).You mentioned the den where you watch TV and  â€œsometimes scary movies  but I need someone to watch them withâ€¦â€ You then looked at me  for quite some time. This is an example of my failure  a low point. Later I texted you  â€œWe should watch those scary movies though LOL.â€ This is an example of my overcoming a failure  through technology  innovation and ACUMEN. It also fits into the larger notes metaphor  which is a metaphor for my life.It was great at the end of the tour to have a brief address from your father about the overall values of the Lawrences. He mentioned â€œfeeling at home hereâ€ and that â€œthe fridge is totally open  all yours.â€ I did feel comfortable  and look forward to grabbing opportunities like the open fridge at a future time. Most relationships do not offer an open fridge policy  it makes you  my beloved Sarah Lawrence  especially well-suited for someone like me. I eat often.I would also be honored to join other people who have dated you  like Ben  James and Brad  who are all cool and  since graduating  have gone on to opportunities such as sex.You are a STUPENDOUS ABODE of knowledge and I would be honored to love you. I like your many parts  which I have reviewed online and on my tour (May 12th). I hope I could learn much about the world  and myself  through our time together  setting me on a path for a lifetime of success. I know I still have so much to learn  like how to kiss and  with your guidance  even third base.Please consider loving me this upcoming Fall.â€” Jacob (from the May 12th tour)|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        18|We are not an advertising agency. We are Hoodwink  a collective of artists  dreamers  poets  storytellers  digital wizards  regular old magic wizards  free-thinkers  freeloaders  disrupters  gambling addicts  misfits  misfit toys that have creepily come to life and refuse to die no matter what we do  and one lone gunman.We cultivate. We think-o-vate. We adver-tain. We make up words. We are sad a lot. We weep every single day.We do things our own way. Which youâ€™ll first encounter in our welcoming conference room that contains neither tables nor chairs  but instead houses a giant nest of human hair harvested from each and every one of our thoughtfully curated employees. Itâ€™s a metaphor for our process and the way our ideas are hatched off the top of our heads. Arenâ€™t the egg pillows cute? Yes  of course theyâ€™re stuffed with hair â€” thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re so soft.Weâ€™re certainly not right for everyone. When you have a business problem  we donâ€™t come back to you with the kind of practical  realistic â€œsolutionsâ€ youâ€™d expect to see in the played-out agency world. We donâ€™t make print ads  we produce visual anarchy. We donâ€™t write copy  we craft maddening  inescapable verbal labyrinths  creating a sense of wonder that compels your audience to ask â€œWhat does this even mean?â€ and â€œWhy do I hate your brand so much now?â€Our presentations arenâ€™t just your run-of-the-mill  same old same old advertising campaigns. Instead  we invent presentation experiences. Innovative  unconventional juxtapositions of creative content in the form of imagery  feelings  loud noises  unusual smells  a smattering of poorly formatted Adobe Acrobat documents  and several real acrobats dangling from our in-office high wire. Youâ€™d better brace yourselves  because youâ€™ve never seen anything quite like it. Also  for safety reasons we recommend bracing yourself against a wall and covering your neck and skull with a hardback book during the performance. Due to the lack of traditional office snacks and lunch breaks  our main acrobat has grown quite thin  and his bony body feels like a bag of knives when it falls on you. Which is both a warning and another unique insight youâ€™ll only get from working with our company.The idea of thinking outside the box and breaking all the rules is so important to us  it even applies to our building. Specifically  Californiaâ€™s earthquake architectural codes as well as most standard asbestos regulations are the rules that we break. Pregnant women are advised to avoid coming within 500 yards of our office  which is fine with us  since we donâ€™t really buy into such an expected procreation method. Our company prefers more modern  innovative reproductive concepts like asexual budding  ripping off an arm and hoping it will grow a new person  and however marsupials do it.Admittedly  we are still working out a few kinks in the loose  unregulated way we structure things around here. None of our employees have ever been paid real money  and the hair nest has recently developed a bad case of lice. Also  there is an actual killer roaming our office. Remember the lone gunman from our introduction? That wasnâ€™t a joke. He is a very real and present danger. Why did we even hire that guy? Itâ€™s not like it was some kind of secret. In his interview he was very upfront about the whole murder thing. He has designed some of our most successful coupons  though.Weâ€™ve been trying to spin these horrible problems into some kind of benefit for our clients  but the only thing weâ€™ve come up with so far is the idea that you should â€œdo something that scares you every day â€ which is very easy to do here. We live in constant fear of being buried alive beneath a pile of asbestos-laden rubble  and all of the rats in our building are covered in bulbous tumors. Maybe one of them will inspire the shape of your new logo?But as an advertising agency thatâ€™s not an advertising agency  but has instead transcended definition  these are just some of the challenges we face here at Hoodwink. Some may call us renegades. Others may call us innovators. And a select few health inspection authorities will call us exactly what we are â€” a huge pile of dirty hair littered with cancer-ridden vermin and human rights violations. But one thing is clear: The work we do here is impossible to copy. One of the tumor rats has gotten trapped inside the copy machine  so now it just spits out gross inky blobs.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               19|Dear Mr. Guest:Thank you for your recent submission  â€œWhat I Talk About When I Talk About Paying Off My Student Loan Debt â€ to Navientâ€™s Loan Repayment Success Story Quarterly. We read it with great interest! We are excited to present it to our student loan borrowers! We know it will encourage the many thousands of borrowers to give us the money they owe in a more timely manner!As you know  repaying your Student Loan Debt is an achievement worth sharing! This past month we received 233 submissions of success stories just like yours. We accepted all of them. Your understanding of irony was the strongest aspect of your submission. It shows us you paid attention while getting your Masters in Fine Arts in Creative Writing fifteen years ago! Another strength in this submission was the intended audience; 91% of our borrowers have an English/Arts degree of some kind.However  we were unable to overlook a few glaring shortcomings. Surely you had a writing instructor at some level who told you that one â€œfuckâ€ is enough in a short story. Two on rare occasions. Three is egregious. Were you aware that you used the phrase â€œFuck you  Navient and your refusal to cancel my automatic monthly withdrawal optionâ€ more than 523 times  Mr. Guest?We also expect a bit of creative license with each submission. But who will believe you worked at The Gap following matriculation from such a prestigious graduate program â€” albeit a low-residency program. Incidentally  were you aware that a traditional-residency MFA graduate receives a two-book deal and tenure track job? Thereâ€™s a success story weâ€™d love to publish! Furthermore  we feel our borrowers would not benefit from reading six chapters about the â€œmind-numbing skull-fuckeryâ€ that consumed you each time a manager asked you to refold a pair of slim-fit low-rise jeans because youâ€™d forgotten to â€œtuck the crotch.â€ And regarding the footnotes detailing the exact budget you lived on at each given moment: a bit much. (Also  like your story title  it was derivative.)Honestly  Mr. Guest  if it hadnâ€™t been for that final chapter on how you overcame bronchitis without antibiotics so that you could donate plasma in order to meet the final payoff amount so as not to incur a hefty financial penalty per the agreement you signed with us when you first took out the loan as an aspiring writer fifteen years ago  the essay would have left us quite depressed. What an exciting ending! We only wish for the same conclusions for the other three undergraduate student loans you have with Navient because you failed to consolidate them at a lower interest rate.That is why we are willing to consolidate your 43 000 words into â€œLive On a Budget For As Long As It Takes!â€ and include it in our â€œTips For Borrowersâ€ section at the end of the Quarterly. Again  as stated in the clause in the box you checked before submitting  Navient has been granted the â€œthe right to edit the submission before it is used in publicity  promotions and advertising.â€ So  we have already published your submission. Thatâ€™s good news for you! Think of the exposure for a writer of your quality!Of course  there will be no pay as you  in submitting  also granted us â€œnon-exclusive  irrevocable  worldwide  royalty-free license to reproduce  distributeâ€¦ in promotions and other publicationsâ€¦ in perpetuity.â€ But  again  think of the exposure! We have borrowers all over the world! Your copy of the Quarterly is available for $27 via our website linked at the bottom of this email.On a final note we want to encourage you to take a vacation now that youâ€™ve paid off your Student Loan. We recommend not using the snowball effect to pay off your remaining debt. Did you know that by saving your former monthly minimum loan payment amount you will be able to visit the The Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes National Park in Northwestern Michigan for two nights and three days in approximately 18-24 months? We can send you a handy coupon book to help you achieve this goal  for a small fee.We do now offer private loans at competitive rates. So once you have regained normal lung capacity  should you want to take a vacation sooner or return to school to gain the necessary teaching experience so you can land that tenure track job  know that you are already pre-approved for a new loan! As an added bonus if you accept the offer  we will throw in a complimentary edition of our Quarterly to inspire you to repay us.In the future  feel free to send us more Success Story Submissions! But please read through the stories of of other borrowers. This will help you gain a better feel for what we are trying to accomplish through our Loan Repayment Success Story Quarterly.Yours in perpetuity  Navient|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 20|Years as a student in higher education: 10Degrees earned: 3Terminal graduate degrees in writing: 2Semesters as a substitute teacher: 4Semesters as a high school teacher: 5 (one as an unpaid student teacher)Sections of first-year college writing taught on a $4 000 per semester stipend: 9Sections of first-year college writing taught as an adjunct: 7Sections of writing or literature taught as a full-time non-tenure-track instructor: 126Creative writing workshops taught: 20Average student evaluation score for fiction workshops taught  on 5-point scale: 4.9Students taught: 3 825Hours in the classroom as a teacher of writing or literature: 8 328Hours in a year: 8 760Pages of student writing read  responded to  and graded: 76 500Hours spent reading  responding to  and grading student writing: 5 100Books published: 1 and 1 forthcomingAdditional unpublished novel manuscripts completed: 5.5Manuscripts that were finalists in book-length writing contests: 3Short stories published: 57Essays published: 17Publications officially recognized by English department or college where I worked: 0Highest yearly salary: $45 000 w/benefitsSalary for same job within same school system last year: $36 900 w/ benefitsSalary offered for same job  same school system  Fall 2016 (didnâ€™t take): $12 000 no ben.Teaching job applications sent  2015 â€“ 2016: 80Job interviews  2015 â€“ 2016: 4Job interviews declined when it was revealed the course-load was 7 classes/semester: 1Job offers  full-time: 0Days currently unemployed: 154Unemployment benefits awarded for 2016 â€“ 2017: $7 150Difference between unemployment benefits or working 50 hrs /wk as adjunct:  â€“ $4 850Tax penalty paid for cashing out retirement early: $20 000Unemployment benefits lost for cashing out retirement early: 50%Years before I reach retirement age: 17Number of pieces in this column: 15Lines on curriculum vita as a result of this column: 15Times I heard through the grapevine someone was unhappy I wrote this column: 6Fan emails received for this column: 6Facebook likes received for this column: 6 000Paid to date for lifetime of writing: $8 500|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          21|Early October InterviewTRUMP: Ducks are reptiles!REPORTER: Uh  youâ€™re saying that ducks and reptiles are both animals?TRUMP: No  Iâ€™m telling you.

I took a shower  rubbing some pink fancy soap into my breasts  which I use even when I donâ€™t have guests. I moaned in pleasure  making that sound that a cat makes when it hasnâ€™t been neutered. My breasts are a foot above my vagina  which I use for both urination and sex. They craved the passionate embrace of a buff dude. Was Kurt that buff dude? I was about to find out.I threw on my cheerleaderâ€™s outfit  because I had practice later that day  and drove my other red Ferrari to the shop  a 2016 F12berlinetta fully loaded with a 730-hp 6.3-liter V-12 engine.Kurt was bent over the car  squeezing oil all over the engine. He had really big muscles  which hot chicks like me are super into.â€œYour car is ready to go â€ Kurt said. â€œSweet ride.â€He had such huge pecs they looked almost like breasts.â€œThanks  dude. How much do I owe you?â€He pulled out a whole bunch of complicated papers. â€œEleven thousand dollars.â€â€œOh  shit â€ I said  when I reached for my wallet. â€œI grabbed the wrong bag.â€ I pulled out a half ounce of medical-grade marijuana.â€œBlaze some of that Chiesel with me and weâ€™ll call it even â€ Kurt said. â€œLetâ€™s go check out my room.â€I followed him upstairs. The hallway was papered with all my favorite movies  like Bring It On  Reservoir Dogs  and Maze Runner: Scorch Trials.We sat on his awesome bed and rolled a fat J that Kurt lit with his blue flame Zippo  which is $35 bucks on Amazon. We played Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on his PlayStation 4 and I got really horny.Then Kurt slowly unbuttoned my dress. My breasts felt like they were going to explode in anticipation of his hot kisses. He put his hand between my legs. It felt amazing  even though I didnâ€™t have a penis.â€œWhoa â€ I said  when Kurt took off his pants. â€œYouâ€™ve got the biggest  grossest dick ever.â€ I was so turned on. â€œLetâ€™s order a pizza.â€â€œNo. Letâ€™s order a pizza and Wendyâ€™s â€ Kurt said.â€œBut they donâ€™t deliver.â€â€œI have a buddy who works there and can totally hook us up.â€Kurt went down on me  spelling the lyrics to â€œPurple Hazeâ€ by Jimi Hendrix with his tongue.â€œAwesome song â€ I said.When he put his penis inside of me it was like sitting on a warm  wet flagpole. I watched myself in the mirror as he screwed me. I looked super hot because I was naked. My giant breasts slapped together in rhythm to Jimi  and Kurt promised to teach me the lead riff later. He made me feel safe. Chicks like me love getting high and then having sex. I couldnâ€™t see Kurt very well because there was a bedpost in the way.We did it doggy-style for over an hour  while we played multiplayer Halo 5: Guardians on his Xbox One  stopping every now and then to kiss and hug  or to eat our pizza and burgers off each otherâ€™s bodies.â€œI love you differently than I love my mom and dad â€ Kurt said. That made my vagina feel hotter than the bonfire I accidentally fell into at camp. I had to go to the emergency room  which sucked.Kurt cried out in a really high-pitched voice  â€œIâ€™m doing it!â€ He exploded. It felt like someone was peeing Pop Rocks into me. His jizz went all the way up to the back of my throat. It tasted like the Vanilla Silk my mom drinks. Not bad on cereal if thereâ€™s no milk around.Milk shot out of my breasts onto the black bedspread as I screamed in pleasure.â€œDonâ€™t worry about that â€ Kurt said. â€œI make enough money that I can hire my mom. She comes every day to clean when Iâ€™m not around or when sheâ€™s not too much of a bitch.â€Afterwards we ate spicy chicken nuggets and smoked more weed. Kurt put his clothes on but I stayed naked so he could play with my breasts whenever he wanted. We kissed a lot. Iâ€™m a really good kisser  even when Iâ€™m crying  which I wasnâ€™t.â€œWould you mind driving my second Ferrari back to my place for me?â€ I asked when it was all over.â€œSure  dude â€ Kurt said. â€œIâ€™d kind of like to meet your mom anyway. Not that Iâ€™m weird or anything. But if your mom knows me and likes me  it will just be easier for us to have a totally awesome summer hanging out and getting high.â€|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          23|I  Kim  take you  Diane  to be my casually wedded work wife.When I met you in new hire orientation  I remember thinking: That necklace is a fun pop of color sheâ€™s added to her business casual neutrals. You also had a really cool planner and I just had to ask where you got it (Erin Condren!). My world changed from that moment forward. You put my name in your phone (KIM WORK) and I put yours in mine (DIANE ACCOUNTING) and I havenâ€™t looked back since.Diane  you are a hot cup of joe on a Monday morning and a canceled meeting on a Friday afternoon. Youâ€™re the first person I think about when CCâ€™ing an email  and the last person I think about when I shut down my computer at the end of the day. Through everything  I choose you. Through office birthdays where Dave brings the wrong kind of cake  and Mondays when the coffee maker is broken  I choose you. Through days when the AC is at exactly the right temperature  and days when that food truck parks in front of the office  I choose you.Diane  I promise to always email you funny memes about accounting and to Gchat â€œlol thank god!â€ when you send me an article about how drinking wine is good for you. Just as you talk me up to my office crush  I will tell Tim about your adult dodgeball team so he thinks youâ€™re interesting. I promise to be faithful and never eat lunch with Karen from HR because sheâ€™s a bitch and she knows what she did. I promise to defend your parking space â€” Dave  driving a Bimmer does not entitle you to take up two spots! I promise to never collect on the IOUs youâ€™ve written me for the quarters Iâ€™ve given you for the vending machine â€” you deserve all the Diet Coke you can drink.I look forward to work wife wedded bliss with you. Together we will rejoice and share some Dove chocolate over victories like that dickweed Dave being fired or our boss being out sick for the day. Side by side  we will convince our boss to let us have Pizza Wednesdays at least once a month and everyone will think  Kim and Diane are so fun! I know I can count on you to get me novelty shot glasses from your vacation destinations because you know you can count on me to get you fun keychains.I vow to make half plans to hang out outside of work but to never follow up on them because we have our own lives and I get that. When one of us is inevitably promoted or moves to a different company  I will lament our lack of closeness and our loss of intimacy. Weâ€™ll still Gchat for a little bit and try to finally get those drinks weâ€™ve always talked about  but we never will. Iâ€™ll look sadly at the succulent you got for my desk and wonder if youâ€™re still using the plaque I got for you that says BOSS BITCH.With this sassy mug  I thee wed.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              24|Dear AMQR Subscriber First off  we apologize. We promised that if you signed up for a one-year subscription to the Arthur Miller Quarterly Review youâ€™d be given access to exclusive  never-before-seen photos of acclaimed American playwright Arthur Miller in the nude â€” photos that have yet to be delivered. By now you may believe such photos do not exist. Perhaps you think we invented them as a cheap marketing ploy to give our niche literary journalâ€™s subscription numbers a boost.Nothing could be further from the truth.Itâ€™s true that AMQRâ€™s sponsoring institution is slashing our operating budget by seventy percent. We acknowledge that in times like these  a journal might be forced to consider guerrilla tactics. But the fact is  we do have nude photos of Arthur Miller â€” clear  high-resolution images that convey a sense of Millerâ€™s sensuality and playfulness  his cool urban intellect and sensitive bedroom eyes.Trust us when we say these nude pics are amazing.Our nude photos of Arthur Miller light up the room; they make the celestial bodies of the heavens look like cheap orbs of space crap. Our nude photos of Arthur Miller are lush and radiant â€” at turns artful and pornographic  candid yet preternaturally self-aware.â€œMy God â€ said our managing editor when she first saw the pictures. â€œCall my family. Tell them Iâ€™ll be home late.â€ She didnâ€™t leave her office for three whole days.These photos of Arthur Miller  lithe and garmentless â€” how shall we describe them? We already did on AMQRâ€™s Facebook page  which has since been suspended  so weâ€™ll repeat our claims here:Our stunning  high-quality images of Miller wearing nothing but his trademark tortoiseshell glasses will Simply. Take. Your breath away. These photos â€” which we promise will be 100% nude  100% of the time â€” feature the National Medal of Arts recipient in tasteful but provocative poses: strolling through the pines at his Roxbury  CT estate; shaking hands with Elia Kazan on the set of Death of a Salesman; kicking over a garbage can in a fit of righteous temper following a testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. For years  itâ€™s been a well-kept secret among literary elite that Miller enjoyed most of his waking hours naked. We intend to bring you the very best of those hours  and so for a limited-time only we are offering a flipbook of select  nude photos of Arthur Miller along with the purchase of a one-year subscription to the magazine Publisherâ€™s Weekly described as â€œone of the top ten journals dedicated to Arthur Miller in southeast Michigan.â€To see Millerâ€™s work performed in the theatre is a revelatory moral experience. To read his words on the page is equally thrilling. But what better way to round out oneâ€™s knowledge of Millerâ€™s career than to gaze upon his lean feet slapping the tile of his sister Jean Copelandâ€™s Manhattan apartment? Why not appreciate the long curve of thigh angling into the petite buttock of the man the New York Times called â€œone of the great American playwrights  whose work exposed the flaws in the fabric of the American dreamâ€?Dear AMQR subscriber  did you know?That Arthur Miller  winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama  commissioned a lower back tattoo of a bucking mustang while filming The Misfits in the sweltering desert badlands of Nevada?That Arthur Miller  author of All My Sons and The Crucible  went eighty-nine years without a single tan line?That Arthur Miller  colossus of American arts and letters  recipient of honorary degrees from Oxford and Harvard  benefitted from the extra vigor of a supernumerary testicle?Our collection of nude â€” shall we call them urgent? â€” photos of Miller shrugging off the shackles of modern dress are not merely a groundbreaking cultural artifact  theyâ€™re what you might call â€” especially for a university-affiliated magazine with unstable funding â€” a game-changer. As the old saying goes  â€œHe who holds the nude photos of Arthur Miller holds the power  and he who holds the power can tell the Board of Trustees to suck it.â€Given all this  why are we coming before you today without any nude photos of Arthur Miller to share?Truth be told  we were a bit hasty in determining the value of our collection. Distributing never-before-seen shots of Miller going full monty for the mere cost of a one-year subscription was irresponsible  if not insulting to the legend himself. Thatâ€™s why now  for a limited-time only  AMQR is offering customers the chance to see the Kennedy Center Honoree in a series of demure  inviting poses: swatting a locust while climbing the heights of a sturdy sugar maple; climbing out of a taxi at 20th Century Fox; and riding a bicycle through the crowded streets of Beijing.These photos and more â€” did we mention Millerâ€™s nude game of six-wicket with Alexander Calder? â€” can be yours with the purchase of a five-year subscription to the journal Poets & Writers once bet â€œwould never make it through the Great Recession.â€ And just look at us now.Order now  and please enjoy the view!Sincerely The Editors of Arthur Miller Quarterly Review|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            25|9/11 â€” no two numbers and a slash have ever meant so much outside of mathematics and Yelp ratings. On the morning of September 11th 2001  four attacks were committed by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda  causing the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York City  damaging the Pentagon in Washington  D.C.  and scuffing up the ground in Shanksville  Pennsylvania.At least thatâ€™s what is commonly accepted to have occurred. However  the only thing conspiracy theorists commonly accept is that anything that is commonly accepted is completely wrong. And if you try to tell them that isnâ€™t logical  theyâ€™ll tell you  â€œLogic Isnâ€™t Logical â€ and theyâ€™ll hand you a shirt with that printed on the front  and youâ€™ll wear it often  because  hey  free shirt.Did the events of 9/11 happen the way the government claims? Was 9/11 actually an Inside Job despite the fact that it clearly took place outside? Who was ultimately responsible for the horrifying loss of life and increased sales of tiny American flags? Osama bin Laden? President Bush? Are they the same person? Iâ€™ve never seen them in the same room and Iâ€™m always looking.In this article  Iâ€™ll examine claims of conspiracy theorists  debunkers  and then rebunk them both using all the words I know how to spell correctly  some I donâ€™t know how to spell correctly  and some nobody knows how to spell correctly.Can I find some truth in the world of Truthers? Most would say  â€œNo â€ but in German  â€œNoâ€ is nein  the eleventh most useful word in the language. Coincidence? I think not.Like my other free shirt says: COINCIDENCES DONâ€™T EXIST.- -Conspiracy Claim: Jet fuel canâ€™t melt steel beams  which proves that it was actually strategically placed controlled demolitions that brought down the Twin Towers.Debunking Claim: The National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that the burning jet fuel didnâ€™t need to melt the steel beams in the towers  only to weaken them enough to bring about the collapse.Rebunking Claim: The heinous attacks on the World Trade Center were perpetrated for one purpose: to educate people on whether or not jet fuel can melt steel beams. Think about it. Before 9/11  maybe a handful of jet fuel experts were aware that burning jet fuel would be unable to melt steel beams. Nowadays  itâ€™s a commonly recited fact  like 2+2=4 or that George Washington was the first President not to walk on the moon. So who planned the attacks in order to get this knowledge out into the world? Think of the smartest person you know. It was probably that person. Blame them for 9/11 the next time you see them.- -Conspiracy Claim: Bush did 9/11. The President of the United States needed a reason to attack and invade Iraq and Afghanistan  so he arranged the September 11th attacks to justify his actions. It was an inside job.Debunking Claim: The 9/11 Commission Report  requested by President Bush and Congress  found absolutely no evidence or support to this claim or any claim attributing the attacks to high-ranking government officials. It was not an inside job.Rebunking Claim:  The 9/11 Commission Report should be titled the 9/11 Omission Report  because it didnâ€™t include the only fact that matters: Bush didnâ€™t do 9/11 â€“ Lee Greenwood did 9/11. â€œWhoâ€™s Lee Greenwood?â€ you ask  like an uncultured idiot. Heâ€™s the writer and singer of â€œGod Bless The USA â€ the â€œIâ€™m proud to be an Americanâ€ song that rose up the music charts as the towers fell  and twice as fast. The song  off of Greenwoodâ€™s famously underrated Youve Got a Good Loving Cominâ€™ album  was originally released in 1984  and after 17 years of almost no radio play  Greenwood knew he needed to do something to get the song some traction. What better way to get a patriotic song some airplay than by planning one of the most devastating attacks on America in all of history? Who were those hijackers then  if not al-Qaeda members? This picture might shine a light on that.- -Conspiracy Claim: While not directly responsible  the government knew about the attacks and allowed them to happen  much like the attack on Pearl Harbor  to propel the country into war.Debunking Claim: At most  the government had memos stating that Osama bin Laden desired to make an attack on US soil  but assuredly didnâ€™t have intel regarding the 9/11 attacks. Even if a war was desired by the Bush administration  it couldâ€™ve been achieved much easier and without allowing the loss of so many American lives.Rebunking Claim: It is very astute to compare 9/11 to Pearl Harbor  because the government was most certainly aware of both attacks and let them happen for the very same reason: to invigorate the film industry. Both â€œsurpriseâ€ attacks gave Hollywoodâ€™s writers easy screenplay ideas  bringing about such great-ish films as Pearl Harbor  Tora! Tora! Tora!  United 93  World Trade Center  and Loose Change. Genius ideas for movies just donâ€™t happen  you have to let them happen  and that involves accepting that thousands of people will die and massive wars will start. You wouldnâ€™t even believe me if I told you what atrocities were allowed to occur for Shrek to come about. Hereâ€™s a hint: it involves Bosnia.- -Conspiracy Claim: The â€œplanesâ€ that hit the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were missiles surrounded by holograms that were made to appear as planes.Debunking Claim: Not only is this supposition well beyond current hologram technology  it cannot account for the missing planes  passengers  and hijackers. This claim is as incorrect as it is absurd.Rebunking Claim: The old â€œthe planes were hologramsâ€ claim is just a hologram of what really happened. Of course there were planes! However  there were no towers. And no Pentagon. And no field in Pennsylvania. Those were all holograms. Always have been and always will be. The Twin Towers were a symbol of business and commerce. They didnâ€™t need to be real. The Pentagon is a symbol of defense and military might. It doesnâ€™t need be tangible. The field in Pennsylvania is a symbol of grass and dirt. It works just as well as a projection as a reality. So if the planes were real  but the things they crashed into were holograms  whyâ€™d the planes explode? Airline food  obviously.- - Conspiracy Claim: Insider trading involving United Airlines and American Airlines  the airlines involved in the attacks  and certain defense contractors proves that there was extensive foreknowledge regarding the attacks.Debunking Claim: The trading irregularities leading up to 9/11 have been explained as unrelated to the terrorist attacks. The only proven foreknowledge of the events has been linked to al-Qaeda and those responsible for the attacks.Rebunking Claim: We didnâ€™t have foreknowledge  but with our current postknowledge  we can always pull a Back to the Future and make it so it never happened.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                26|The key to asking a successful question to a literary festival panel is preparation. Youâ€™ll want to have every detail of the preface to your question prepared  such as your name  age  and entire medical history. Donâ€™t worry about the actual question; you can make that up as you go along.Once you finally find the microphone after several doomed attempts to follow the clear directions of the host  youâ€™re going to want to cut short your unprompted analysis of how your eczema has influenced your approach to creative nonfiction to ask an important question:Can the sound guy give you some more foldback  please? You really need some more foldback for when you ask your actual question.O.K.  so the audience is starting to get a bit restless during your back and forth with the sound guy  and a few people are throwing moleskines at your head. Give them some time. Eventually theyâ€™ll understand that this event is actually all about you.Wow  someone just got you pretty good in the kidney with a hardcover Sylvia Plath anthology. But donâ€™t doubt your approach now  youâ€™re really getting into some interesting territory here with this weeping-into-the-microphone-and-explaining-that-youâ€™re-trying-a-lot-harder-to-be-present-at-the-moment schtick. Take time to remind yourself that those arenâ€™t necessarily boos youâ€™re hearing; itâ€™s most likely just your imposter syndrome playing up again.So  security says one more attempt to guilt-trip the panel into doing a table read of your one-act play and youâ€™re going to be escorted out. I guess youâ€™re going to have to ask a question. Just make sure you donâ€™t fall into the all too common trap of asking about the work of one of the panelists. Writers hate nothing more than reflecting on their work in a way that illuminates both the audience and themselves not just about their own writing  but the very nature of writing itself. Yawn.No  what the panel really wants to do is give you very specific career advice thatâ€™s only applicable to your very specific situation.Youâ€™ve got to be kidding. This panel of Dante Alighieri scholars say they have no words of wisdom about getting a foot in the door of the fiercely competitive erotic thriller e-book market? Well  guess you better ask a question about their work. Just try to make it as protracted and impenetrable as possible. Hereâ€™s a fail-safe option if youâ€™re really stuck:â€œIn 1977  the Voyager spacecraft launched  taking with it phonograph records of sounds and images that could show extraterrestrial lifeforms what life is like on planet Earth. Firstly  why were none of the panelistsâ€™ audiobooks on the Voyager? And follow up question  does this demonstrate a failure of the audiobook industry  the Voyager  or the ability of your prose to translate into the audio form? And follow up follow up question  if you could invite three guests  living or dead  to a dinner party  would you invite Carl Sagan? And if not  would that be because he was in charge of compiling the phonograph records that were on the Voyager spacecraft? Because if so  thatâ€™s totally understandable  Iâ€™d be annoyed too.â€Ouch  does the security guard really have to grab your neck so tight while dragging you out? Does he not care at all about the welfare of your snood? Itâ€™s O.K.  pain is temporary  but those confused looks you received from the panelists will last forever.As you stand outside  you might think your interaction with the panel is over. Wrong. Pick up where you left off by live-tweeting your medical history using the literary festivalâ€™s hashtag. As this hashtag belongs to a literary festival  you will be the only person using it  and your tweets will automatically appear on the giant screen behind the panel. Donâ€™t be put off tweeting by the piercing screams of audience members. What these people donâ€™t understand is that  through your actions today  you have actually asked them all an important question.Is it ever worth sticking around to hear the audience Q&A at a literary festival panel?|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                27|"[Part I  Part II  Part III  Part IV  Part V  Part VI  Part VII  Part VIII  Part IX  Part X  Part XI  Part XII  Part XIII  Part XIV  Part XV  Part XVI  Part XVII Part XVIII  and Part XIX"".]- - -Part XX: In Which King Gylfi of Sweden Learns about the Fimbulwinter- -So like I â€™as telling yah  Thorâ€™s been passed out  yah know  just sleepinâ€™ it off undah some wicked deep pileâ€™ah snow on the sideâ€™ah the road ovah by Haymahket since fuckinâ€™ Saint Pattyâ€™s Day but then he finâ€™ly wakes the fuck up â€˜cause now his stomachâ€™s stahtinâ€™ tah growl nâ€™ he needs tah eat some food fahrâ€™is fuckinâ€™ hangovah.

Debris is all around them. Sounds of explosions and alien ray guns can be heard outside. LORELAI frantically tries to fix a coffee machine while Rory sits  pale and speaking rapidly under her breath.]RORY: Wow  aliens. Stars Hollow sure has changed in the last three months. Not the bucolic wonderland I remember. It was nice to see Dean again though. Nice to see him turned into a pod person. Nice to shoot him.LORELAI (speaking through teeth clenched around a screw from the coffee maker): Yeah  youâ€™re a regular Ripley now that these aliens have made our town their home  arenâ€™t ya?RORY: Ripley? The incredible Mr. Ripley? Tom Ripley of Ripleyâ€™s Believe It or Not? Because believe me  I donâ€™t believe it at all. Not at all. Not one bit.LORELAI (sighing): Ripley! From Alien! Sigourney Weaver in her break out role! I alway knew all that studying was no good. Reading the Tom Hardy Boys didnâ€™t get you ready for an alien invasion  did it?RORY: Well  no  but a lot of literature features themes of alienation and thatâ€™s pretty close  right?[LORELAI lights up  the coffee maker is working! She smiles  pats the coffee maker and jumps up to grab that sweet sweet Java from the counter. As she stands  TAYLOR looms behind her  sweaty  besweatered and covered in gore. His eyes glow an unearthly green. LORELAI shrieks and RORY jumps up. They take turns shrieking.]TAYLOR (his voice a low  rasping groan): Got toâ€¦ ensure theâ€¦ historical feelâ€¦. is preservedâ€¦ for Korak!!![He pulls his hand back  revealing a twisted stub  half tentacle and half claw. Just as he is about to strike thereâ€™s a THWACK  his eyes roll up and he collapses to the ground. Behind him stands LUKE  a bag of party ice in each hand.LUKE: You can never have too much ice.- -EXTERIOR (NIGHT)  STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE[Our party exits Lukeâ€™s diner  LORELAI and RORY clutching coffees  LUKE dragging a bound and gagged TAYLOR  and stands  regarding the town square. The gazebo is half crushed by a flying saucer embedded in the ground  debris fills the square  some burning  some smoldering. The town sign still stands  proudly but slightly charred.]LORELAI: Well  weâ€™re going to have a little bit of cleaning up to do before the next parade.RORY: Oh  a parade! I canâ€™t wait for our first annual Victory Over the Invaders Parade! Itâ€™s going to be quite a spectacle  all tin foil and antennae and all sorts of alien accouterment.LUKE: Take it easy  alien hunters. We havenâ€™t gotten rid of them yet. Waitâ€¦ do you hear that?[LUKE stops and cocks his head]LUKE: Oh  God  theyâ€™re coming![LORELI and RORY listen intently to the low rumble in the distance. LORELAI purses her lips and squints.]LORELAI: Mmmmm. I donâ€™t know about that â€” the aliens have more of a screeeeeeee whoa whoa whoa whoa scrreeeeeeâ€¦RORY: Chucka wooka Chucka wooka screeeee screeee[LORELI and RORY continue making sounds. LUKE is not amused.]LUKE: Will you please SHUT UP![LORELAI stops making noises. RORY continues.]LORELAI: Thatâ€™s definitely the sound of a large diesel engine. Really large.RORY: Like construction equipment? Is someone going to steamroll the space invaders?LORELAI: Maybe. Definitely sounds like someone  someone human  is coming to help. Just a question of whoâ€¦RORY: The government?LORELAI: Is this the kind of response time youâ€™re accustomed to the government offering? If thatâ€™s the case then Iâ€™m moving to where youâ€™re living! Do you have a bed for a middle-aged mom fleeing alien persecution?[The sound gets louder  almost there. Suddenly a massive tan military vehicle pulls into the square  running down the sign that had up to now stood so proudly. All three glance at TAYLORâ€™s supine body.]LUKE: Well  glad he didnâ€™t see that.[The tank  or whatever it is  pulls to a stop in front of the trio. A hatch on too pops open and as they wait  breath held  out pops the helmeted head of a woman.]MS. PATTY: Hello  Sailor![MS. PATTY smiles and gives them a wink  the well chewed  mostly smoke butt of a cigar jauntily between her teeth.]LORELAI and RORY: PATTY?!?MS. PATTY: Who else?[The door of the tank opens. Out pops KIRK  shirtless but nonplussed.]LORELAI: KIRK?!? You have a tank?!?KIRK: No  I do not have a tank.RORY: Kirk  if you donâ€™t have a tank then what are you driving?LUKE: Itâ€™s an MRAP  a big armored army truck that can take bomb blast like nothing happened. Real popular in Afghanistan.[KIRK gives a serious nod.]KIRK: And itâ€™s not mine. Itâ€™s my uncleâ€™s.[MS. PATTY calls from her position at the top of the truck.]MS. PATTY: Itâ€™s a helluva ride. Reminds me of my monster truck days.LORELAI: While I do need to hear the story of your monster truck days  right now I think we need to figure out what to do about our interstellar tourists. Kirk  I assume youâ€™ve got a plan?KIRK: We were going to have dinner. Luke  are you serving dinner tonight?LUKE: No  Kirk. The restaurant is closed due to unforeseen events.KIRK: Huh. Too bad. Is anything open.LUKE: NO  KIRK! The whole town is under alien attack and you want a hamburger?!?KIRK: No  I want a chili burger.LUKE: THERE WILL BE NO CHILI BURGERS UNTIL THE ALIENS ARE GONE! What the hell are you planning on doing with your MRAP anyway?KIRK: Just taking it for a test drive. Seemed like ideal conditions to try it out on rough terrain.MS. PATTY: Rides like a dream.[Just then a black jaguar careens around the corner into the square. It skids out  hits the curb and spins into the gazebo with a spray of dirt and a loud crash. After a moment the door opens and EMILY GILMORE gets out confidently  fixing her hair with one finger  a cocktail shaker in one hand.]EMILY: Surprise  surprise  finding you two at the diner on a night like this. Get your coffee already?LORELAI: Nice to see you too  Mom.RORY: Hi grandma!LUKE: Emily.[EMILY reaches into the car and grabs a martini glass. She pours a clear  frothy liquid from her shaker into it and takes a drink.]EMILY: Not the same without an olive but I suppose it will do.LORELAI: Martinis? Aliens invade and you jump in the car with a shaker full of martinis?EMILY: Oh  give it a rest Lorelai. Aliens invade and you DONâ€™T have martinis?RORY: She makes a good point  Mom. Got anything else to drink  Grandma?MS. PATTY: Any bourbon? Maybe some absinthe? Seems like the time.[EMILY opens the back door of the jag. The back seat is piled with cases of liquor and ammunition.]LORELAI: Now the liquor I remember from my childhood  but the ammo is new. Why exactly do you have enough bullets to stage an invasion of Canada?[EMILY quickly finishes her drink and pours another.]EMILY: Because  Lorelai  the trunk is full of guns. Now  are we going to do something about these aliens or are we going to stand in the square like weâ€™re at one of your ridiculous town festivals?|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            29|Portrait by Kelly Bjork.- -Soon after the shooting  authorities cordoned the Twilight Exit and began processing the crime scene. It took all night and the following day. In the case file  a detective described the barâ€™s interior  with its hardwood floors and â€œlilac-purple painted walls â€ she noted. â€œAlthough multiple hanging ceiling lamps were in use  the lighting was fairly dim. There was an open area  presumably used as a performance space for karaoke. A television displaying â€˜Sing like a proâ€™ was hung from a wall above a fake fireplace.â€ The lounge and dining areas â€œwere in a state of disarray. Tables and chairs were turned over. Laptop computers  cell phones  clothing  and other personal property had been left behind throughout. Half-eaten food and beverages remained on the tables and bar.â€ Later  when the Twilightâ€™s long-time manager Shira entered the space  â€œit felt like everything was frozen in time â€ she told me. â€œAt one table  it was obvious that someoneâ€™s birthday party had been interrupted. That made me so sad.â€â€œCSI left a mess â€ said the Twilightâ€™s owner Stephan in a separate interview. â€œTheyâ€™d moved everything that wasnâ€™t bolted to the floor. They dug into the walls. They wanted to be sure they found all the bullets and the casings. They left flags and sticks and measuring-tape stickers over every bullet hole â€ he said. In the lounge  authorities recovered bullet fragments from approximately a half-dozen strays. One bullet chipped the tile floor  others left holes in the wood-paneled walls. One shattered a stack of glasses. Another entered the ceiling  nicked an electrical wire  and somehow yanked out a portion of its copper. â€œBullets do weird things to stuff â€ said Stephan. â€œThe damage was incredible.â€Shira and I skip back to the moments as she was first entering the bar. â€œThere were a couple investigators  and I think there were one or two uniforms  but people were mostly wrapping up  grabbing their stuff  and heading out â€ she said. Shira mentioned sheâ€™d previously gone to school for forensic science and criminal justice  and â€œone of my classes was taught by the head CSI guy for Seattle. His name is Brian. I walk into the bar and there he is. He was like  â€˜Hey! What are you doing here?â€™ We had a little conversation  just shooting the shit for a second.â€ Shira asked Brian about the puddles of blood in the lounge. â€œI was like  â€˜Hey  can we clean this up?â€™ and heâ€™s like  â€˜No. You have to get somebody professional to do it.â€™ For the disposal or whatever â€ said Shira. â€œThe blood and dead stuff doesnâ€™t really bother me. I wouldâ€™ve rather just done it myself  but I did find a guy like we were supposed to. We googled him. He showed up  he wasnâ€™t wearing an official hazmat suit. It was one of those white painter ones you zip up and buy at Loweâ€™s. He didnâ€™t even have any shoe coverings. Just his regular shoes. Of course he just mops it up and puts some bleach down. Thatâ€™s just like what I wouldâ€™ve done! I wanna say it was around $200 to $250 because I remember haggling with him about the prices  saying you know  itâ€™s really not that much to clean up.â€Before the clean-up guy arrived  Lexi and I stopped into the bar. Apart from Stephan and Shira  the place was empty. Stephan immediately asked if we were going to sue him  and we said we werenâ€™t. (â€œI didnâ€™t know him  and I wasnâ€™t even thinking about that â€ said Lexi.) Weâ€™d come to retrieve our jackets and purses. Weâ€™d abandoned them when we fled the building the night before. Having no keys  cellphones and money brought obstacles to our following day. In the lounge  I saw the blood on the tile floor where James had fallen. Someone had placed a folded-open newspaper over the pool. These were likely the same pages Lexi had been flipping through as she sat at the counter  just before the shooting began. I hadnâ€™t slept the night before  and everything was strange. When Lexi got her credit card and receipt from the bar  she saw sheâ€™d been charged a gratuity for leaving her card overnight. (This was an accident  Stephan later said.) Lexi also grabbed the boots sheâ€™d left behind. Sheâ€™d slid them off beneath Whitneyâ€™s body as Lexi was struggling to get away. They were soaked in blood. (â€œWe called them the Sticky Boots. I picked â€˜em up  and Shira took a rag to them â€ said Stephan.) Lexi went sock-footed the night before  and all day sheâ€™d made due wearing cheap footwear a friend bought for her. â€œThey were fuzzy indoor slippers  and they were soaking wet because it was drizzling all day. I was basically walking around in these blue square sponges â€ she said.Throughout our interactions that evening  Shira seemed remarkably grounded. When I asked her where it came from  she attributed a previous job in a funeral home. â€œI was helping with the services â€ she said. â€œIâ€™d set up or take anything down. Iâ€™d help the grieving family  or Iâ€™d drive them somewhere if they needed. Things like that. I was in the process of getting my funeral directorâ€™s license  but there was this one instance where I decided I just couldnâ€™t do it anymore. This old woman was saying goodbye to her husband. I was standing right next to the casket. She walked up to him  and she said  â€˜Iâ€™ll see you soon â€™â€ said Shira. â€œOn the job  you canâ€™t cry  and you canâ€™t show emotion  but that just crushed me. It reminded me how my parents were with each other. Both are deceased. After my mom died  my dad died like a year later â€ she said  then continued. â€œThereâ€™s a human connection that we canâ€™t see or measure or anything like that  but itâ€™s there  and there are very few instances you can actually see it  but when do  youâ€™re just in awe. I was like  thatâ€™s true love  oh my god. It totally creeped me out  and I loved it  but also thatâ€™s when I knew it was time for me to go â€ she said. â€œI decided to go into bartending instead.â€We return to the bar the evening after the shooting. After Lexi and I gathered our things and went away  Shira eventually called in another employee  and the two went to work. â€œI just wanted to hurry up and get done â€ said Shira. â€œWe moved all the tables and chairs and mopped and cleaned. We took all the liquor down and gutted behind the bar. We went over everything with brushes and damp rags. We had to be really thorough. We made sure there was nothing to see and nothing to talk about. We wanted to get it back to the same old Twilight â€ she said.Switching gears  I bring up Whitney and James. Shira recognized them as regulars. â€œTheyâ€™d been coming in a good while. They always argued. All the time. Itâ€™s really sad how things turned out. Obviously he had troubles  and she really knew how to push his buttons â€ said Shira. â€œTheyâ€™d come in separately. Normally sheâ€™d come in first  and then heâ€™d come in after. They never sat together. Theyâ€™d be silently arguing. Theyâ€™d be glaring at each other  and no words were being spoken  and then he would leave  or she would leave. And then one would come back. It was like this revolving door of them coming in and out. It was stupid and weird â€ said Shira. â€œBut yet they would always take care of each other. If she ended up leaving  heâ€™d pay her tab. Or vice versa â€ she said. When the two were ready to make up  â€œtheyâ€™d go outside and have a cigarette and talk quietly. Or theyâ€™d sit together in Loversâ€™ Corner â€ she said â€” referring to a counter for two in the lounge.As Shira remembered Jamesâ€™s interactions at the Twilight  â€œhe was never rude to any of the employees â€ she said. Often heâ€™d mention his fatherâ€™s sports bar. â€œItâ€™d be like an â€” â€˜I see you. We should be nice to each other. Iâ€™m in the industry too. Letâ€™s hang outâ€™ â€” kind of thing.â€ Weeks after the shooting  Shira ran into Whitney at a grocery store. She was by herself  said Shira  and â€œshe was moving slow  but she was walking.â€ They greeted each other briefly  and Whitney described a bag she mightâ€™ve left on the scene. That was the last they spoke. According to rumor  Whitney later attempted to patronize the bar  but she was asked by staff to leave.Stephanâ€™s impressions of James and Whitney were similar to Shiraâ€™s. â€œTheyâ€™d always be arguing  but Iâ€™d never seen them yell at each other. Theyâ€™d do the silent treatment. They were the quietest fighters ever. Iâ€™ve seen her storm out. The first few visits I saw them  I didnâ€™t realize they were together â€ he said. Whitney was â€œreally pretty. Really cute. Sheâ€™d come in in her scrubs and do homework â€ he said. James â€œalways wore a gray beanie. I never once saw him without it on. Even when he was working out. Iâ€™d see him at the Y  and heâ€™d be wearing the beanie â€ Stephan said. â€œHeâ€™d always want to tell me about his problems. â€˜My dadâ€™s bar isnâ€™t doing that well â€™ or â€˜My sister sucks â€™â€ he said. â€œOnce  I saw him getting arrested out front. His car was parked by the bus stop. I guess he came in  trying to get his girlfriend to go home or something. He had his kid in the car out there with nothing but a onesie  and this was January.â€ (According to the police report filed in municipal court  â€œthere was no child restraint used â€ and â€œthe child was lying free in the seat â€ and the child was â€œnot dressed for cold weather.â€ As Stephan remembers  James claimed he hadnâ€™t left his child alone and asked Stephan to procure footage as proof  but the barâ€™s security cameras were broken  and no film existed.)The last time Stephan saw James  it was the afternoon just before the shooting. â€œIt was cold but sunny that day. I was hanging out with my son. As we were packing up the stroller to leave  James arrived with his kid. Whitney was already here at the bar. It was probably five or six. I think thatâ€™s when all the problems started. They were doing the pouty thing â€ he said. â€œJames gave me a bad vibe  but I never thought he wouldâ€™ve come in here and done that â€ he said. Several hours later  police stationed Stephan outside the bar as they processed the crime scene  and he observed authorities transporting Jamesâ€™s body from the building. Stephanâ€™s response was unemotional. â€œI think they used a white bag  and that kind of surprised me â€ he said  when I asked what details stood out. â€œIâ€™d always thought body bags were black.â€The shooting impacted Stephan in other distinct ways. â€œMy lawyer heard about it and called me immediately. He told me  â€˜Donâ€™t talk to anyone. You donâ€™t want to give anyone ammunition to sue you.â€™ We went through a lot of red tape  with L&I and with the insurance companies. They acted like weâ€™d contributed to what happened  but this couldâ€™ve happened anywhere. It was a random occurrence  and it was something I didnâ€™t want people to associate with the bar. Once we heard Greg was going to be OK and all that  we just wanted to make everything go away as soon as possible. When my lawyer said I should stay closed for a week out of consideration  I thought: consideration for who. We opened up right when we could â€ said Stephan. â€œThis was a really expensive event for me. The repairs were close to a thousand dollars. We werenâ€™t open that Sunday and the next couple days  so we lost revenue. Plus my insurance went up. They cancelled my liability. They cancelled everything. I had to pay a lot more to get it renewed. We had a benefit for Greg  and I gave him all the profits for the night. All in all  weâ€™re looking at twelve to fourteen thousand. Thatâ€™s not nothing. I wouldâ€™ve had fourteen thousand in my pockets that has now vanished.â€- -Photo Credits: Seattle Police Department.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         30|[Originally published October 20  2009.]- - -I donâ€™t know about you  but I canâ€™t wait to get my hands on some fucking gourds and arrange them in a horn-shaped basket on my dining room table.

Youâ€™re either ready to reap this freaky-assed harvest or youâ€™re not.â€Carving orange pumpkins sounds like a pretty fitting way to ring in the season. You know what else does? Performing an all-gourd reenactment of an episode of Diffâ€™rent Strokesâ€”specifically the one when Arnold and Dudley experience a disturbing brush with sexual molestation. Well  this shit just got real  didnâ€™t it? Felonies and gourds have one very important commonality: theyâ€™re both extremely fucking real. Sorry if thatâ€™s upsetting  but Iâ€™m not doing you any favors by shielding you from this anymore.The next thing Iâ€™m going to do is carve one of the longer gourds into a perfect replica of the Mayflower as a shout-out to our Pilgrim forefathers. Then Iâ€™m going to do lines of blow off its hull with a hooker. Why? Because itâ€™s not summer  itâ€™s not winter  and itâ€™s not spring. Grab a calendar and pull your fucking heads out of your asses; itâ€™s fall  fuckers.Have you ever been in an Italian deli with salamis hanging from their ceiling? Well then youâ€™re going to fucking love my house. Just look where youâ€™re walking or youâ€™ll get KOâ€™d by the gauntlet of misshapen  zucchini-descendant bastards swinging from above. And when you do  youâ€™re going to hear a very loud  very stereotypical Italian laugh coming from me. Consider yourself warned.For now  all I plan to do is to throw on a flannel shirt  some tattered overalls  and a floppy fucking hat and stand in the middle of a cornfield for a few days. The first crow that tries to land on me is going to get his avian ass bitch-slapped all the way back to summer.Welcome to autumn  fuckheads!- - - -Available in print withThe Best of McSweeneyâ€™s Internet Tendency|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           31|If youâ€™re anything like me  you probably take a lot of medication.This might be because youâ€™re tired  bored  have too many children  or have run out of coffee. But for some  the changing of summer into fall  also known as the â€œCornucopia of Sadness â€ is a time of year that calls for an aggressive chemical lobotomy.At the onset of fall you may notice a shifting of vegetation from vibrant green to yellow and brown hues before shriveling up in pain and falling to the ground. That is the effect of the cooler climate creating an environment so unsuitable for foliage that it slowly ceases to live and withers before your eyes  perishing over the course of a few weeks.As our hemisphere turns away from the Sun  the air takes on a chill  and we begin to get a small taste of what life would be like if Earth rotated so far away that it spun aimlessly out into space  hurling through the dark and cold  without light or warmth  forever. Some cultures have theorized that this is natureâ€™s way of reminding us  annually  that we are always on the precipice of utter emptiness and obliteration. Just something to ponder as you drive home from work in the dark.With our furtherance from the Sun also come shorter days. A day still lasts twenty-four hours  but we spend more of those hours in total darkness. Want to use the extra darkness to sleep more? Too bad. You still have to continue to function as if the world isnâ€™t ending. This will mean using a flashlight to walk to the bathroom in the morning and watching the sunset from your office window soon after youâ€™ve had lunch.In Europe  the word for fall is autumn  because it sounds fancier and is more likely to lead to sex. Autumn comes from the Latin autom  literally translated as  â€œall the nice things are dying all around you.â€ In ancient Greece  Atto was known as the god of waning pleasure and was responsible for summerâ€™s end. In modern culture  the name Atto is still evoked in the face of poor weather  evasive orgasms  and that thing of when a restaurant is really great and then it changes management and the service starts to go downhill. By the sickle of Atto!!At the end of the 18th century  some menfolk who wanted more time to play golf implemented the practice of Daylight Savings Time from spring until fall. This could have been adopted as a year round practice  but wasnâ€™t  because our society is amused by the discomfort of those who require a certain amount of sunlight to want to continue to live. Also  extra daylight between Halloween and Easter is useless when youâ€™re a simple hemp farmer. With slaves. I digress.Many of us employ certain methods for dealing with this change.Some turn to sports this time of year. Not the playing of sports- the watching of other people playing sports  whilst yelling and occasionally leaking the salty bodily fluid known as tears.Parents send their children to school come fall because theyâ€™re too sad and tired to continue to look at their filthy faces all day while inventing forced craft projects.Countless others wipe the dust off their slow cookers  unearth the goat intestines they have buried in the back yard  and get to work on a four day stew.And still some find solace in maxing out their credit cards on yoga pants from Patagonia  which they will wear while grocery shopping and waiting in line at the DMV.Another coping mechanism that weâ€™ve readily embraced is the flavoring of many unrelated food items with the member of the gourd family commonly called â€œthe pumpkin.â€ The pumpkin has become a symbol of fall because of its prominence in the annual Pagan celebration of Reeseâ€™s Peanut Butter Cups and also because of Charlie Brown.But pumpkin flavored food is not  in fact  pumpkin flavored. It is actually pumpkin-pie flavored. Pumpkin pie is a common delicacy served at the second fall holiday  Where We Eat Starch and Ponder our Debt and Fight Day  also known as â€œThanksgiving.â€For many Americans  the requirement of all things to taste like a specific type of pie made of a purÃ©ed gourd and sugar is a successful defense tactic against circadian disorientation. Why is there no Peach Spice LattÃ©? Because when peaches are in season you can see your hand in front of your face at three in the afternoon.If you are lucky enough to have natural immunity to the Cornucopia of Sadness  take it upon yourself to look out for your fellow tribe members straggling behind the pack. They can often be found napping in parked cars  alone at the movies on a Monday  or gently weeping in the Target bathroom.If you come across one of these people  take them out for a taco supper. They probably need the protein. Then  when they get up to empty their bladder of the fourth margarita youâ€™ve ordered them  drop ten milligrams of Lexapro in their drink (or Welbutrin or Zoloft- all of these drugs have the exact same effect on everyone). You will need to do this every day around the same time for about two weeks for it to really take effect.When you confess your scheme to them two weeks later  their seratonin re-uptakers will be so well calibrated they wonâ€™t even be mad. They will probably thank you and offer to reimburse you for all the Lexapro  which will be good because itâ€™s extremely expensive out-of-pocket due to unfettered capitalism.HAPPY FALL  EVERYBODY!|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    32|Last year  my wife Diane and I decided to take an inventory of our lives  relationship  and future. At the time we were both living comfortably  with over $100K in annual earnings to show for it  but there was something missing. It wasnâ€™t kids  pets  or lavish trips  no. We needed an injection of passion and excitement into a life that had grown stale over the better part of a decade. Thatâ€™s when we decided to make a drastic change. We decided to cut the proverbial fat and went all-in on a cozy 174-square foot tiny home  and  Iâ€™ve got to say  it has completely revolutionized how my wife and I fight.Just twelve months ago  Diane and I were living in a cumbersome four-bedroom  three-bathroom residence  free from any drama  and now we engage in all-night shouting matches on whether or not we should throw out the slow cooker because itâ€™s taking up too much counter space.  Thatâ€™s the kind of fire weâ€™ve long been lacking in our relationship.  The almost-nonexistent storage space has forced us to only rely on the essentials. Early in our relationship you would never think that we would get into vicious knock-em-down  drag-em-out altercations about water usage in a home that fits comfortably on a truck bed  but we dared to dream. Many coworkers and friends ask me  â€œwhy would you want to live like that?â€ and I always answer with an exhausted  â€œwhy not?â€ Who needs space  time and hobbies  independent from their beloved  when the enraged bellows of marital misery can easily echo through our tiny bungalow  igniting years of loveless complacency.What else has changed  you ask? For one  Diane and I do more sleeping on the pull-out couch and sleep loft  respectively. The limited space has all but eliminated chances of having much-needed friends over for soirees  which is good because it now allows more time for deep-thinking about the choices weâ€™ve made  and where it all went so wrong. The decision to downsize also saved us an immense amount of money. The cost for construction and building materials were a mere $56 0  leaving us more than enough money to fund consultations with divorce attorneys and intensive couples counseling sessions.Sure  from an outside perspective it may seem like Iâ€™m miserable  but do you understand the rush of adrenaline that comes from screaming into the throw pillows that were  â€œnon-negotiable â€ after an evening-long quarrel about solar panels to make our little place of love more eco-friendly?Some say happiness has completely left me. Not at all  my wife and I are extremely happy at our jobs because they are a welcome respite from countless hours of verbal spars about compost piles and de-clutter.  Weâ€™ve been able to gain lasting friendships with our respective bartenders for fear of coming home to the other and getting into it for a sixth consecutive night.If you would have told me seven years ago  when I first met Diane  that we would be screaming at the top of our lungs about why we only have two sets of silverware and have to empty our latrine in a KOA campground like we live in some post-apocalyptic  Mad Max-esque hellscape  I wouldâ€™ve said you were out of your mind. But  now that I am in the thick of it  I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way. My blood is constantly boiling  and she gets the opportunity to walk on eggshells IN HER VERY OWN TINY HOME. The anger that wells up in us every time my wife and I dodge glances  is only matched by the good our extreme efficiency is doing for the environment. And thatâ€™s the greatest gift of all.So is it worth all the money you saved? Well  let me put it this wayâ€¦ when I look into the eyes of my spouse as she does dishes in our bathroom-kitchen hybrid and I see the eternal look of resentment on her face  well  you canâ€™t put a price tag on that.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    33|Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. As you know  Iâ€™ve been working here for nine years now. I work long hours  weekends  and even cover for others when they fail to get the job done. Iâ€™ve been a model employee for all nine of these years without so much as a thank you to show for it  much less any significant raise or promotion. So I just wanted to let you know  that in ten years or so  Iâ€™m getting the fuck out of here.I know this might come as a shock  but every man has to have his breaking point  and at some point in the distant future  I may just reach mine. When I took this job after college  I just thought it would be a temporary thing to support my new family while I found what my true passion is  and I think ten or fifteen years from now  Iâ€™ll finally realize what exactly that career would be  and depending on if it provides the same life style my family and I have grown accustomed to  I just may go for it.Look  this isnâ€™t personal  but these long hours and weekends are keeping me away from my son and daughter. I need to spend more time with them. Theyâ€™re getting older and just starting to get into sports and dance. By walking away from this eventually  I can awkwardly try to form a relationship with them after theyâ€™ve moved away for college. No parent should be denied the chance to go from stranger to acquaintance in their adult childrenâ€™s lives.And donâ€™t get me STARTED on how this is affecting my relationship with my wife! Iâ€™m constantly missing dinners by staying at the office late  and our weekend plans are constantly up in the air. Just last week I told her weâ€™d go up to the lake house and I had to cancel it at the last minute because Campbell didnâ€™t finish the Smith Contract on time. Instead of spending time with my wife  I was cleaning up the mess of your terrible managerial skills. We had a huge fight and sheâ€™s sick of it. Frankly  Iâ€™m pretty sick of it too. Weâ€™re hanging on by a thread and if something doesnâ€™t change  our relationship will probably only last another twenty to twenty-five more years.I cannot continue to let you people walk all over me for the rest of my life. One day  Iâ€™m going to have too much pride to let that happen  and if that day comes  you  or the person in my department who gets promoted over me to take your job after youâ€™ve retired  can take this job  and shove it. I couldnâ€™t be happier to get out of here in ten years. Or fifteen if my kids need to stay on my insurance.Thanks again for your time. If you need me  Iâ€™ll be at my desk.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      34|I see you  boy on subway.The way your hair gently clings to scalp because of the sweat youâ€™ve egested while working to internalize Janieâ€™s struggle from sexualized girlhood to sexualized womanhood.The way your shirt was once upon some time tucked into your pants with a belt for security but everything  even Tea Cakeâ€™s rabies  devolves into chaos.

In my youth it was an industrial town â€” lumber and  especially  coal  with all the associated rough-and-readiness  but surrounded by beautiful forested mountains.My father took a job with a mining company and moved us to this region when I was very young. I grew up trying very hard to get away from mining but kept going back and getting summer or full-time jobs to tide me over until my next big thing. After coming back to Fernie following university  and in the dying months of my first marriage  I got a job at one of the areaâ€™s five coal mines. It was a low-stress  high-paying job that allowed me to buy a house  read as many books as I could afford  and eventually remarry and start a family. I continue to work for that company today.Since my return  the town has evolved into a skiing and mountain biking mecca  with all the funky shops  pubs  and cafes that come with that. There is still an uneasy tension between the communityâ€™s past and present  but mostly it has de-escalated to drive-by shoutings rather than the random beatings of outsiders.The townâ€™s past and present are both represented on my key ring. First thereâ€™s the brass â€œ30â€ lamp tag. When a miner went down into the mine  he handed over his identifying tag and was issued a flame safety lamp with the same number. The tag was typically put on a peg with all the other minersâ€™ tags from that shift. When a miner ended his shift  he handed in the lamp and got his tag back. If there was a tag left on the board  that meant a miner was unaccounted for and a search typically commenced. The underground mine closed in the late 1950s  so I never worked there myself (I started as an equipment operator in an open pit  which is a different kind of mining)  but I found a bunch of the tags when I worked in a warehouse later on and kept one for my key ring.The black and gold discs on my key ring are mountain bike lock-on grip end caps  which are ubiquitous on the townâ€™s biking trails. When I was growing up here  you only rode a bicycle if you were younger than 10 or if youâ€™d lost your license for driving drunk  but now the town is a haven for mountain bikers. In the last 10 years Iâ€™ve become an avid mountain biker myself  so my key chain nicely captures the evolution of my town  and of my own evolution within it.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       36|"1.     â€œDown Escalator (Intro)â€2.     â€œMake America Skate Againâ€3.     â€œCalifornia Mini-Phallusâ€4.    â€œA League of Her Own (Rosieâ€™s Song)â€5.     â€œTo Russia  With Shoveâ€6.    â€œThe Song Where Each Verse is a Surprisingly Well-Reasoned Lesson the American Electorate Shouldâ€™ve Learned From the Brexit Vote (But the Choruses Are About Drinking)â€7.     â€œThe Star-Spangled Scammerâ€8.     â€œStatue of Synergy (Hillaryâ€™s Song)â€9.    â€œLetâ€™s Talk About Black Lives Matter (For a Minute and 45 Seconds)â€10. â€œWho Killed the Zodiac Killer?â€11. â€œThe Shining Cityâ€™s Off the Pillâ€12. â€œ$27.00 (Bernieâ€™s Song)â€13. â€œThe Song Where We Make It Clear That Weâ€™re All Feministsâ€14. â€œSeriously  Itâ€™s Important to Us That You Know Thatâ€15. â€œWeâ€™re Feministsâ€16. â€œNo Really  Check It Out: This Songâ€™s Acoustic and Clumsily About Womenâ€™s Issues (And the Music Video is Gonna Be a Slideshow of Our Moms)â€17. â€œNow That Weâ€™ve Irrefutably Established the Fact That Weâ€™re Feminists  Hereâ€™s a Song Thatâ€™ll Tacitly Encourage Men to Get Overly Aggressive at Our Showsâ€18.  â€˜Depth From Above (The Droneâ€™s Song)""19. â€œBattle Hymn of the Weed-Publicâ€20. â€œRetweet the Nuclear Codes (Oi  Oi  Oi)â€21. â€œWiki-Mediaâ€22. â€œI  Woke (feat.

I have happily drained all of my money  along with my parentsâ€™ savings account into said college with one goal in mind: to work for you for free. Though I have spent the last half decade  and $80 000 learning about a single topic  I assure you that I know only enough to not run your company into the ground  but not quite enough to get paid. I would relish the opportunity to not be noticed in your office building for a few months  so one day I can ask another company to pay me.The only thing I ask in return for my free labor is some â€œinsight into the industry.â€ Which is to say  Iâ€™ll run out the clock bringing you coffee while you get my name slightly wrong every time we interact. This internship will allow me to put your company name on my rÃ©sumÃ©  so that one day the manager of the restaurant I wind up working at can know what my dreams once were.I hope the calculated and evenhanded wording of this letter gives you a professional image of me. At the very least  I hope it cancels out the actual images you mightâ€™ve seen of me on Facebook  wielding an array of glow sticks and a quart of vodka. I also hope that this saccharinely optimistic tone Iâ€™ve been using properly masks the growing desperation I feel when I think of my future.I can prove myself an asset to your company; having â€œinvested in myself â€ I will cling onto anything resembling a job with a death grip.In closing  I am so very glad that the cover letter  something that was once a nice personal touch  has become another hoop to jump through in the application process. Iâ€™ve spent the last quarter of my life â€” along with every dollar to my name â€” on an education; something hailed by high school teachers everywhere as â€œthe key to my future.â€ And it is comforting to know that the success of all this effort hinges on a 500-word document. It seems mutually beneficial that you as an employer have to re-read a hyperbolized version of my rÃ©sumÃ© in paragraph form  and that I have to write something unique and personal  while using the cadence of an office memo.Thanks for your consideration A future overqualified bartender|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                38|David Mary (ccâ€™d) forwarded me your latest soft/hard bounce rate report this morning. I must admit  in my seven years of marketing I have never encountered a set of data such as this. The tenderness and raw emotion you convey in such a simple medium touched my soul. My heart  which I thought had hardened in the face of so many soulless depictions of keyword optimization results and B2C market segments  ached from the sheer beauty. On this grey workday I wept at my desk.I was immediately struck by your choice of font. Letters sans serif shows your desire to cast off the fetters of movable type. We have entered into a world no longer reliant on crude slugs of metal smashed against paper. Without these physical bonds  our SQL queries can transcend the world and rise to their rightful place in heaven. Itâ€™s the data-driven equivalent of Rembrandtâ€™s The Ascension. To be in the presence of such beauty in no way makes me regret my degree in art history.And donâ€™t think the significance of Tahoma  a standard font in the initial release of Windows 95  escapes me. Using a twenty-one-year-old font  one at the beginning of adulthood  is a statement that your artistic childhood is over. Your work has matured since your 2015 SEO Keyword Preliminary A/B Testing Results. Itâ€™s ready to make a name for itself â€” to excel  if you will â€” on the world stage.Oh  but the colors! Most traditional report builders bold the top row but you do away with such tradition  choosing instead to change the cellâ€™s fill color to #BFD2E2 and leave the font untouched. Clearly  this is an allusion to the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as described by Marx. Instead of superficially bold leadership  separate from and superior to the other cells  we have a ruling class that is identical to the true heroes  the workhorses that convey the bounce rate data we need.â€œBut we bring order to the data. Without us it is meaningless!â€ the imperialistic column headers bawl  secure in their high towers. But behind the pale blue curtain  they are no different from the working-class. Deep down we are all 11-point. Itâ€™s a sly wink to the marketing assistants who will be forwarding this report to other marketing assistants around the globe in the service of middle management.But yours is not an idealistic representation of the labor struggle. You chose to include the campaign â€œEnd Dateâ€ column  even though itâ€™s well known that our recent upgrade to Cognos 8 is unable to access this specific row in the database (to the great frustration of our IT department). The result is a conspicuous white line of empty cells in an otherwise rich tapestry of data â€” an obvious memento mori. We all have an end date  your work declares  but â€œwe know neither the day nor the hour.â€ Every row in the cosmic spreadsheet of the universe ends in a question mark that not even our modern-day soothsayers  the business analysts on floor 7  can answer until it has already come to pass.When faced with such perfection I admit I was eager to find some fault. My gaze came to rest on the first column  â€œItem id.â€ Surely  I thought  David knows our internal style guide requires all abbreviations include a period. How could he make such a glaring error? Then it occurred to me: this is no abbreviation of â€œitem identifierâ€! Itâ€™s a reference to the primacy of the id  Freudâ€™s concept of humanityâ€™s basic  instinctual drives. To have this in the first column and the first row  cell A1 â€” Adam  the first man â€” indicates that no matter the rigidity of the framework  this piece of art  and by extension all of manâ€™s creative endeavors  are subordinate to our baser desires. I have yet to discover your allusions to the ego and superego in the spreadsheet  but I am certain they are there.From the moment IT hired you after 18 months of temping  I knew you were something special. But I could never have imagined you would reach such enormous heights with your work. You have created art that transcends time and space; a perfect entity that no doubt will change humanity for the better.Mary brings up a good point  however. Itâ€™s still defaulting to paged format when you export it to Excel 2007  which is a huge pain to sort. Can you fix that in the next iteration? Itâ€™ll have to be before Thursday. Russell thinks weâ€™ll increase our conversion rate by starting the campaign before the holiday weekend.Thanks!â€” Kevin|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             39|I have to participate in a never-ending charade for the sake of my college roommates  a charade in which I never make any dark political jokes but always make the bed  with the fitted sheets actually fitted and the comforter pulled back just right in a way that undermines the fundamentals of my personality. I look at my roommatesâ€™ carefully arranged spaces with bewilderment â€” where do they think we are living? An IKEA catalog? A YouTube guruâ€™s beauty tutorial? Did they go to college to continue their educations or to display their assortment of cutesy pillows  each of which comes in a different style  color  and size  but still manages to accentuate the others perfectly?More updates: I sometimes forget how to open my dorm room door. I have no money and no marketable skills. My roommates are the first strangers in years to see my hair sans headscarf. (Yes  Muslim girls take their scarves off at home. When we pull them off  our heads do not fall off  and no we do not shower with them. Youâ€™re welcome.)Long before the drama surrounding my headscarf  there was the drama surrounding my hair. There were elementary school classmates  sticking their fingers into it and pulling like cotton candy at a street fair. There were endless cosmetic solutions tasked with fixing the testy problem of my heritage: keratin treatments  odd smelling serums  heat-based procedures that burnt my nine/ten/eleven year old ears. There was the one light-skinned aunt who suggested that if I exfoliated hard enough  my extra melanin would fade away  I would come to resemble her more  and all world conflict would immediately cease.But my darkness is not the kind you can wash down the drain. Moroccan hamams  Turkish spas  American showers  and 18 years later: still nothing. My hijab has made my once-distressing hair completely irrelevant to the public â€” until now  that is â€” but the â€œproblemâ€ of my skin remains. I look too â€œblackâ€ to be properly Arab/North African  and the insecurities I have developed after years of familial scrutiny cannot be covered by any amount of cloth.Whenever I visit Morocco and find myself both blessed and overwhelmed with the aforementioned relatives at all times  skin deep concerns seemed to replace others. After all  in the country where Iâ€™m from  wearing the headscarf is not particularly noteworthy. But at the end of every beach day  my complexion would be â€” and at least one relative would make sure I knew it. They would say: khaâ€™aliti â€” â€œyouâ€™ve blackened.â€ From their tones it became clear that this fact was a bad thing  a laughable thing. My mom might ask me if I wore sun protection or worry that my sunblock actually seemed to encourage tanning. An uncle might point out that I looked neither Moroccan nor American  and by the way did I exercise enough back in New York?American racism is expected  trademark  foundational â€” the type of thing I write a good slam poem about once in a while and kind of almost learn to live with. But Moroccan racism (that is  the racism I have observed in certain Moroccan relatives) is more complex. I cannot use the excuse of being an outsider when I stake my complaints and write my poetry. â€œMoroccoâ€ is the word Iâ€™m supposed to write about in conjunction with words like â€œhomeland â€ â€œdiaspora â€ â€œancestral.â€ Morocco is to blame for this skin  but refuses to take the credit  distances itself from the consequences  ignores me in my moments of self-destruction.The betrayal feels worse when I consider the fact that Morocco is a Muslim nation and that its people own a wide variety of skin tones. (Of course  Muslim nations generally follow whichever distorted version of Islam proves most convenient  but my indignation is not a force that can ever be reasoned with.) The prophet Mohammed (pbuh) once said: â€œThere is no virtue of an Arab over a foreigner nor a foreigner over an Arab  and neither white skin over black skin nor black skin over white skin  except by righteousness. Have I not delivered the message?â€Nope  apparently not.On a good day and in the right outfit â€” especially if I have my jet-black eyeliner on â€” I feel cocky in my appearance  mysterious in my ethnic ambiguity  powerful against the perceptions of others. I admire how rose gold looks on my wrist  how brick red blooms on my full lips and accentuates my brown skin. (I do so in my roommatesâ€™ mirrors when they are gone  because I have yet to invest in my own.)But there was a time when I refused to leave the house during the heat (light?) of a summer day. I remember hiding in the shade of a building while I waited for the street light to change  so that I could cross the sunny expanse as quickly as possible. Whenever I noticed the color gradient on my forearms  the strips where my sandals once crisscrossed and my rings once rested â€” a kaleidoscope of damning evidence â€” I couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that I had lost something irretrievable.Itâ€™s easy enough to applaud Christian Louboutin for designing nude heels for dark women. To idolize Lupita Nyongâ€™o and to criticize Azalea Banks and Lil Kim for lightening their skin. To curate your Facebook feed so that it exclusively swarms you with articles titled: Brown Women Goddesses Slay in Latest Ad Campaign/Olympic Sporting Event/Political Endeavor.But am I really comfortable with my own blackness? Are we as a nation comfortable with the physical appearance of blackness? The blackness that goes beyond Kylie Jennerâ€™s appropriated braids  Nicki Minajâ€™s rear end  and Beyonceâ€™s latest album? Are our childhood lessons and internalized biases as easy to unlearn as a #blacklivesmatter retweet?I donâ€™t think so.I canâ€™t pretend to be some sort of social justice warrior for the Black Lives Matter movement  or any similar movement in another country  when I still struggle with my own exterior. To be skin sure  to acknowledge the lessons I have internalized (wider noses = ugly  darker skin = ugly  blacker = ugly) and work to reverse them  will prove more powerful than using an empowering hashtag.  That is something I think I will focus on this year: completely accepting the basic  superficial  literally skin-deep reality of my mixed appearance.My roommates will probably not be bothered about what my skin or hair looks like  whether I look more â€œblackâ€ or â€œArabâ€ and where that puts me in terms of traditional beauty standards. In their positions  I know that I wouldnâ€™t: I seem to wield all disturbing critiques of the physical variety against myself.The chemical treatments that my relatives forced upon my hair when I was a young girl ultimately destroyed it. Years later it grew back jagged and angry  broke off in little pieces when touched: no longer cotton candy but salt  or snow.

The Trump rally is jam-packed with jaded writers from all corners of the Internet â€” PolitiWord  MindLeashUntruthed  The Honeydew  VERY BEST TEACHER SHARES  the Paypal Blog â€” each hoping to wring some traffic out of yet another â€œinside Trump ralliesâ€ article.Desperation is a common theme here. For many writers  paid opportunities simply donâ€™t exist anymore  and on some level  their collective  swelling frustration is understandable.â€œI already have a thumbnail picked out â€ one writer declares  showing me a screenshot on his phone of Trump mid-speech with his eyes slightly closed  possibly while saying something goofy. â€œJust need some racist quotes and this babyâ€™s GTG.â€ The image is a bit blurry and will end up costing him clicks  but I know better than to rile these people.â€œTrump just has such huge BALLSâ€ yells another man to my right  filming an on-location character bit with his sketch group. Heâ€™s clad in a SHILLARY SHNEVER T-shirt showing a crude pic of Hillary in an old timey jailbird outfit holding a serial number that says EMAILS and chained to a metal ball that says BENGHAZI with a cap that also says EMAILS. The entire event is full of similarly boorish  vulgar T-shirts â€” a far cry from those excellent T-shirts you see all the time.At this point I realize I should probably throw in a tactile detail. I look around perceptively and notice a hot dog cart with a yellow and blue umbrella. It says either SCHILLMANâ€™S or SKILLMANâ€™S or something  but the details donâ€™t matter to these people; rally goers line up  undeterred by such vagaries and motivated probably by the bad parts of religion  eager to scarf down their ready-made hot dogs and bottles of lukewarm water.â€œIâ€™m working the â€˜we donâ€™t trust journalistsâ€™ angle â€ another attendee offers unprovoked  showing me her outline so far. â€œBut if I snag some F-words I might lead with that.â€ The vulgarity of the crowd is indeed striking; theyâ€™re likely sick of the constant condescension they receive from every writer but me.More yelling and more chants erupt in pockets throughout the growing crowd. I initially came here to write a story about people yelling at Trump rallies  but this? This was not at all what I expected.â€œSorry  I donâ€™t have you on the list?â€Iâ€™m snapped out of my ruminations. These thunderous words from the organizer at the press tent flawlessly underscore an evening of burgeoning divisiveness. I explain to her that I havenâ€™t called ahead for credentials  but that I just plan on quietly standing with the press corps  jotting down ridiculous things I see and maybe firing off some incredulous low-quality pics on Twitter. I even show her my awesome shareable article title with swear words in it (our site can do that)  but she remains predictably unconcerned.Iâ€™ve been deported from the Trump rally. The irony is so thick  Iâ€™ll probably make it the Facebook share description.â€œLock her up!â€â€œSheâ€™s a Satan Woman!â€â€œEmails? SHE-FAILS!â€These are three things people are conceivably shouting inside the arena  I imagine  as I stride poetically away from the now-filtering-in crowd.On my way out  I stop for a hot dog. I bite into the mustardy flesh  hungry for instant gratification but knowing  deep down  that thereâ€™s nothing of substance to this meal. I finish the last bite  stride past the rows of metal crowd control barriers  and head off towards a third taut metaphor.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 41|July 24  2016Patient â€œAsh Ketchumâ€ came into my office for the first time today since our phone consultation. His primary problem  in his words  is that he wants â€œto be the very best  like no one ever was.â€ A telltale perfectionist. He seems to be highly dependent on his own evaluations of himself  trapped beneath self-imposed standards of excellence. He continues his fruitless desire to â€œbe the very bestâ€ despite the risks it puts on his life. I explained to Mr. Ketchum that success is both relative and highly subjective  but he found it difficult to accept. He insisted that â€œto catch them is [his] real test  to train them is [his] cause.â€ It is my professional opinion that Mr. Ketchum defines his self-worth solely by his ability to capture and train PokÃ©mon and that re-examining this drive through cognitive behavioral therapy will lead him to a happier and more fulfilling life.August 7  2016Mr. Ketchum insists on bi-weekly sessions  rather than weekly  in order to accommodate his busy training schedule. I pointed out to him that dedicating so much time to catching PokÃ©mon is whatâ€™s causing him the mental distress in the first place  but travel seems to be a substantial part of his regimen. â€œI will travel across the land  searching far and wide â€ he told me. â€œEach PokÃ©mon to understand the power thatâ€™s inside.â€ This emotional relationship is unhealthy. The patient seems to think that without him  the PokÃ©mon will be unable to achieve their true potential  even though he previously showed me that his own self-worth is defined by his ability to train PokÃ©mon. Could this toxic co-dependence be the root of his anxieties?August 21  2016Todayâ€™s session was a troubling one. After a grueling multi-week trek to the gym in Saffron City  Mr. Ketchum returned to Pallet Town  defeated. Under his breath  he muttered with eyes glazed over  â€œgotta catch â€˜em all.â€ It seems his need to catch all of them is a compulsion  fueled by his obsession with destiny; although he cannot control the uncertainties of his own life  he can control the number of PokÃ©mon he captures.September 4  2016He seemed tearful today. At one point he told me I was his best friend in a world he believes we must defend together. He is unsure of what we are defending the world against; his anxiety is vague in that way  but he believes both of us have the courage to take on this monumental task. However  this â€œus vs. themâ€ thinking indicates that perhaps Mr. Ketchum has a black and white view of the world. I briefly wondered if perhaps I were breaching some kind of professional boundary by entertaining his delusions of grandeur  but it worked in the interests of the patient.September 8  2016Mr. Ketchum stopped by my office without an appointment today. I chose to accommodate him as I had a gap in my schedule and he seemed quite nerve-wracked. He paced around my office and demanded he teach me and I teach him about PokÃ©mon. I suggested we try something new: an exposure treatment. If Mr. Ketchumâ€™s greatest fear is being unable to capture PokÃ©mon  why not emulate that fear in a safe  controlled environment? I started by showing the patient pictures of empty PokÃ©balls and rare candies long forgotten  laying stale in the back of the freezer  but the exposure was overwhelming for Mr. Ketchum. He kept repeating to me  over and over  â€œGotta catch â€˜em all.â€ I am unable to get through to him and undo his negative patterns of thought using traditional psychotherapeutic methods  so the next course of action will be to start Mr. Ketchum off on 20mg daily Clonazepam and monitor his condition. Perhaps the pills will help him understand the power thatâ€™s inside of him and will remain there regardless of how many Pokemon he gotta catch.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                42|1. NightOn the terrible shore of loneliness and LaCroix  she pressed her thumb to the red flame on her rectangle phone and watched the screen glow to life  a lighthouse in a sea of despair meant to lure her to sinewy safety or a savage and charmless rock.From her living room  four stories above the cantankerous city that honked and swore its way into her very ribcage  Violet stretched her kind and smart legs across the coffee table and sighed in the way that only an exhausted and jaded single-lite could â€” routinely.She swiped thoughtfully at first and with intent  letting the poorly-lit selfies and romantic slurs (Be as pretty as you are smart  Impress me and Satisfaction is death) dent the surface of her brain.Swiping with fever and fervor through a sea of endless faces  she knew he was there  the one  trapped in this dumb  dumb  stupid  dumb rectangle phone. Her thumb and forefinger traced miles to find him  and then  like winter melting into spring  there he was: Mikael. A vegetarian veterinarian who likes to travel and claims heâ€™s funny and sarcastic but not everyone gets him â€” 6â€™4â€™â€™ because that seems to be important.Right she swiped and the screen went black  bonked their heads together to signal that yes  theyâ€™d chosen each other. Mikael  she thought. Mikael.She composed a message  carefully considering his pictures â€” him holding a labradoodle  flanked by friends shouting at sports  wearing Patagonia beside a tree â€” and tried to knit her heart together with his through a single message when his arrived.With expectations ballooning  Violet read her soon-to-be loveâ€™s words or  rather  his word: â€œHey.â€A needle  sharp to her hope yet pointless beyond its width. Immediately she withdrew to the kitchen and ate a steak she grilled her goddamn self.2. DayThe train platform smelled of grease and sun  the summer day collapsing around the city like a wet paper bag. All around her were men and women  women and men  and dogs barking for more mail in the distance.â€œIâ€™m sorry â€ a man-voice said  a hand touching her elbow. â€œBut do I know you? You look so familiar.â€Violet turned to take in the manâ€™s full posture  noticing the gray of his suit pants and jacket and thinking how hot he must be  boiling in this vengeful sun with his arms and legs covered evenly and doubly in some places.She brought her pale wrist to her brow for shade  imagining the word lady as she did so and took her deliberate time to reply. â€œUnlike friends or acquaintances we have not met â€ she said. â€œBut I understand why you would believe you had seen my face and the reason is you have  and Iâ€™ve seen yours  and we chose not to choose each other.â€He turned his noble head to the side and laughed. â€œHa! Of course. So many faces that slide by my eyes each day  the ghosts of almost lovers  the coffees and ice creams and drink-grabbings that never were â€” donâ€™t you find it exhausting  terrifying even  the endlessness of it?â€â€œOf course â€ she said  shifting from foot to foot and her handbag too  lady  lady. â€œBut what else are we to do?â€â€œWell  we are conversing now â€ he said. â€œPerhaps this is how it should be done  in person on a train platform  rather than through rectangle phones where our skins grow as thin as the glass screens upon which we type.â€â€œYes  but the only reason this conversation was struck was for recognition of my face and  without that  would we even be talking?â€His laughter swept both their minds to one side and then the other. â€œTrue  true â€” when youâ€™re not wrong  youâ€™re right.â€ He appeared sad to her  his face no longer the shine of a peach but of a rotting clam that has learned its life was fished for naught.3. MorningThe date began simply enough  with her arriving on time and him too  she was impressed to see  for this was not always the case. In fact  a rare and special treat  like breakfast for dinner or a goldfish that lives to see a year.Speaking of breakfast  that wasnâ€™t quite what they were having on Halsted but almost â€” a cousin of breakfast  so brunch.â€œHello â€ he said as he stood over the table pointing to a chair. â€œThat for me? LOL.â€ Out loud he said it  the word LOL  not a word at all but an acronym lying about being a word.Was this a joke  she wondered  this saying of LOL and perhaps he knew it was a joke and that she would get it  for jokes are meant to be that way â€” shared and gotten.â€œHa!â€ she said  â€œHa  ha! Thatâ€™s funny  youâ€™re funny â€ she assured him  and cleared her throat  standing to deliver a quick hug. She always did this  no matter whom the he was because the premise here was that they would determine if their souls were meant to be together  and where better to start than with a hug?What she hoped to feel: something  anything that made her realize this was the hug that would hold her always. A hug that meant summer barbecues  friendsâ€™ weddings  days in dog parks  and an emergency contact number that belonged not to her parents.What she felt: nothing  and as he spoke more nothing perched  nested  laid eggs  and caught the avian flu inside her. She smiled to the beat of his drum because he was a musician and had brought his drum  and she listened as oblivion and awful rhythm rained down upon him.Thank heavens for pancakes and frittatas  so the drum could be retired beneath the table. â€œIâ€™ve long known I was special â€ he said  stupidly. â€œPeople have always told me how special I was and they continue to do so now and Iâ€™m sure they will do so always because I am special and great â€” the greatest  in fact!â€Milky egg wobbled on the edge of his fork as he directed praise toward himself. Jump  she thought at the egg. Save yourself from his tireless jowls. He smiled at the special words he spoke  quite pleased while looking at Violet. â€œWhat do you think of me?â€ he asked  the answer he would hear already etched into his middle ear.Feeling parched and nauseous  she sipped her water and thought about canaries. She wished she had one now so she could place it on the table and see how long it took for the canary to die inside  allowing Violet to just barely save herself. How selfish and terrible  she thought  yet still found the idea appealing.With ashen breath  she responded that she felt as ill as his drum skills  which he took as a compliment and promptly left her with the check because  he said  he dealt in talents and not dollar bills and had already contributed much too much.4. BathroomShe has considered more faces of men while on the toilet than upon  at  or in any other location  swiping left  right  left again. Can one be both flusher and flushed? she wondered. The truth is that this happens every time one says no to another and another says no to the one  but no one â€” neither the one nor the another â€” ever knows. Flush  flush.With grate of metal lock and creak of fatigued hinge  she strode from stall to sink and began to wash her hands. Wringing water and viruses from her wrists  her rectangle phone buzzed on the counter  a bumblebee gathering pollen and hinting at the potential of something sweet  filling  nourishing  absolute.It was a match with a man named Kevin â€” a man named Kevin who could perhaps help her survive the long  long winters accustomed to which sheâ€™d grown but would grow accustomed to no more  for sometimes shrinking is the greatest growth one can gift to oneself.A second buzz announced the arrival of Kevinâ€™s message  landing graceful and prompt  the words sheâ€™d been waiting for  a vacuum sweeper to extract the loneliness from within â€” speak now  sweet Kevin  and remove all clouds of doubt.â€œBig tits?â€A tender message to serve as both beginning and end.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           43|- -Good news  everyone! Animation is magic. When I wake up a chipmunk brushes my teeth while three raccoons dress me in the usualâ€”hilarious graphic tee; open long-sleeved button-down to keep it profesh; cargo shorts filled with stolen work pens  loose change  and bunny stamps I told my wife were for work things. Youâ€™re probably thinking  â€œWhy the chipmunk and raccoons?â€ Because the higher ups get the blue birds and fawns  but that doesnâ€™t make it any less magical. Water cooler gossip is limited  though  since nobody wants to talk about their families thanks to the unusually high number of orphans in the building. I usually spend the morning playing with laser pointers and discussing character design and performance (todayâ€™s focus is butts). A mustachioed toymaker leads a parade of confetti-throwing marionettes to signal the start of the mandatory daily foosball meeting (though the marionettes have been sort of downtrodden since one of the vending machine possums ate their bug friend). Lunch is usually served by some other animalsâ€”talking ones  wearing shirts and shoes  but not pants for whatever reason. This has prompted food safety concerns  but the 8-foot tall bipedal dog wears a chef hat so itâ€™s probably fine. Yesterday I filmed myself twirling while wearing a tiara and impractical shoes to channel my inner princess until I fell down and ripped my shirt.

I shakily set down my cup of coffee  my body buzzing with adrenaline and caffeine.The essay was titled â€œThe November of Her Years: My Motherâ€™s Final Thanksgiving at Her Brotherâ€™s House.â€â€œLove the stuff about ur momâ€¦ it gives me ~ all ~ of the feels â€ my editor later wrote via Instant Messenger (â€œmy editorâ€ â€” just thinking about her like that gave me goosebumps). â€œQuick fact-check: what does ur uncle do 4 CA$$$H?â€â€œTimâ€™s a retired nurse  but heâ€™s gotten into computers and now does volunteer work with hospitals up in Maine to improve their databases and keep down costs â€” the state has hit a rough financial patch.â€â€œBROGRAMMER ahahahahahaâ€¦ ur next-level HILARIOUSâ€¦ u do u â€ she wrote. â€œYou mentioned ur mom and uncle were âœ.â€â€œYes  they were lapsed Catholics  but they found some comfort in religion at the end of my motherâ€™s life.â€â€œSo Tim didnâ€™t invite any1 Jewish to the dinner smh?â€â€œAnyone Jewish? Technically speaking  no â€” we were keeping it to just our immediate family  because Mom was so sick. But he wasnâ€™t intentionally trying toâ€”â€â€œLolwut!â€ she wrote. â€œItâ€™ll be up super-1st thing tomorrow.â€â€œWait â€” donâ€™t you want to give me a chance to look over your edits?â€â€œKthxbai!â€ came on-screen before she logged off.The next morning the essay was the lead feature on the site. The headline was â€œI Canâ€™t  I Just Canâ€™t: My Coder Uncle  Whoâ€™s THE WORST  Had an Epic Anti-Semitic Meltdown at Thanksgiving.â€ Here was the beginning:â€œIâ€™m chowing down on stuffing gravy turkey (om nom nom) while trying to tune out my Silicon Valley creeptastic uncle as he victim-blames the economy on the Jews.â€â€œThat moment when youâ€™re at my familyâ€™s literally insane Thanksgiving. HOLIDAY FAIL.â€â€œThanks for running the piece â€ I emailed my editor. â€œHowever  I notice you attributed various remarks to my uncle that werenâ€™t in the original essay and removed all the references to my mother and her passing away the next week.â€â€œU mad?â€ she wrote. â€œTbh  those parts of the essay were kinda Â¯\(ãƒ„)/Â¯  because death.â€Then the comments section began filling up.â€œWowâ€¦ just wow â€ was the first. â€œEssaysplaining clickbait by a caged-poultry-eating Zionist.â€â€œGreat job  you technophobe who clearly has a bias against parentsâ€™ male siblings â€ said another that went on for three paragraphs before concluding  â€œNo words.â€Interview requests and violent emails flooded my inbox. I was fired from my job without severance for violating a morality clause. My landlord evicted me.â€œThe piece won teh Interwebz!â€ my editor wrote on IM. â€œSince we own all the media rights in perpetuity  we optioned the movie  video game  and action-figure (!!!) adaptations 2 Michael Bay. WHAT. IS. EVEN. HAPPENING?!?!â€â€œMy family has disowned me â€ I told her. â€œMy uncle filed a libel lawsuit against me.â€â€œAwkwaaaaard AF.â€â€œIâ€™m getting death threats.â€â€œ#HatersGonnaHate amirite?â€ she replied.â€œI donâ€™t think you understand â€ I typed. â€œIâ€™m very scared for my safety and my life is in tatters.â€There was a long pause before she wrote again.â€œBut dat Michael Bay tho.â€Fast-forward to six months later. After numerous emails to my editor  then someone in accounting named Shelly  then someone in HR named Dennis  then Shelly again  I finally receive a check in the mail. Itâ€™s for $50 and is accompanied by a handwritten Post-it.â€œOh hai! Itâ€™d be totes amazeballs 2 publish u again â€ my editor had scribbled. â€œI can haz more essays?â€I crumple it up  but before I throw it out  I realize I need the money desperately  and  perhaps more important  that although Iâ€™m battered and scarred  distrustful of people and cynical about the art of memoir in the digital-media landscape  not to mention living in a different city under a new name at a YMCA  the traumatic experience has forged me  for better or worse  into the person I now am.Reader  I sent her a dozen pitches.#YOLO.- - -Teddy Wayne will be on tour this month in support of his new novel  Loner.Locations and times can be found here.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       45|Dear Preeclampsia You have been the friend every woman longs for during the exhausting final months of pregnancy. Your thoughtfulness was extraordinary â€” you saw clearly my need for rest and relaxation during such a stressful time.Sure  I would have preferred a nice hotel and massage  but three weeks on a intermittently-inflating bed and 5 AM blood draws were a close approximation. While not having to get out of bed to pee was a nice touch  I have to say that I would have liked a chance to look into what other spa services were available. The staff was a little pushy  checking on me every three hours  but they refilled my water as needed.Please donâ€™t think me ungrateful; I know you were looking out for my best interests  making sure I was taken care of with food delivered moderately warm and unsalted right to my bed. At least  when I was able to eat at all â€” that was one of your most creative gifts  a nice magnesium cleanse to help me get a head start on losing the baby weight.You know I support the arts  so you arranged for the IV pump to sing me the song of its people at unpredictable intervals  and you even gave me a head start on the whole adult coloring book craze.You went out of your way to help me avoid stretch marks and torn lady bits  and outdid yourself in your commitment to avoiding the woes of the third trimester. No way would I have gotten my body back as quickly if Iâ€™d carried the pregnancy to term!Whereas many pregnancy illnesses are nothing more than an annoyance  you helped me meet my dear son two months earlier than I could have dreamed. I was then relieved of the burden that comes with a screaming baby in the middle of the night  since you arranged for him to stay right there in the hospital for five weeks.You thought of everything!But did you have to try to kill me? It really sends a girl mixed signals.Sincerely Rhiannon Giles|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   46|Do you often take to the Internet to share your strong feelings about The Bachelor  the X-Files reboot  or the career of Bill Simmons? Have you successfully destroyed scaly hellbeasts from the bowels of the earth? If so  you should join the PopStart family  where we aim to combine media coverage with an opinionated (and hilarious!) voice.Here at PopStart  our mission is simple: we want to break interesting stories for a hip  young audience  and send the Demon Lord Karazaar back to the underworld. In case it isnâ€™t obvious by now  we like to keep things light. As a member of our staff  youâ€™ll spend time interviewing A-list celebs  playing Ping-Pong or napping in our hammock room during breaks  and casting blood spells to penetrate the dark magic that makes Karazaar impervious to weapons. We boast a team comprised of two Pulitzer-prize winners  three MacArthur geniuses  and a former presidential speechwriter. With your help  weâ€™d like to add â€œbadass demon hunter of doomâ€ to that list.As a member of our staff  your responsibilities will include: writing whip-smart stories that crackle with a mix of your voice and PopStartâ€™s; interviewing celebrities and musicians about their projects; wiping down your hammock after use; and finding the Orb of Tiranius  which can open a direct portal back to hell. On slow news days  we might even have you sneak into Karazaarâ€™s lair  which is in the break room. Weâ€™ve heard rumblings that his groin is his weak spot  but since heâ€™s a demon made mostly of groins  itâ€™s hard to tell exactly where that is. Weâ€™ve been periodically taking turns hitting him with a bat blessed by seven blind monks to try and determine that. Weâ€™d absolutely love it if you would take a crack at itâ€¦ please?Since we live in a digital world  and would rather have you hear it from the horseâ€™s mouth  weâ€™d like you to know that you wouldnâ€™t be the first blogger/destroyer of the evil and undead that has joined our team. Over the last year  weâ€™ve had four other PopStart staffers succumb to the pressures of the job. What can we say  we like to work hard  and hide in terror throughout the day even harder. To be honest  the main problem has been Karazaar  who has either killed  eaten  or turned an otherwise morally upright blogger evil with powers we donâ€™t yet understand. If you could crack how that happens  it sure would make a great piece for our Science section!While the job may seem like itâ€™s all writing editorials on Kanye West and trying not to cry when one of our former employees/Karazaarâ€™s evil minions gives a speech about something called â€œThe Days of Locusts and Thunder â€ it definitely has its perks! We offer a competitive dental plan  401k  and  when Karazaar has slipped away to gather his strength in the darkness  access to all the craft beer and kale chips you can handle! Also  if you can kill Karazaar  Jennifer has agreed to name her baby after you (before or after birth  it doesnâ€™t matter)  and one of our MacArthur staffers has agreed to put in a good word for you over at Vanity Fair  which we hear has a similar issue with a demon named Greg  the Intern of Destruction.Here at PopStart  we constantly get asked why we donâ€™t just dissolve the company  elect Karazaar CEO  or burn the building down and hope he doesnâ€™t survive and hunt us down one by one. Apart from the fact that we all poured an outlandish amount of money into this company  we like to ask: Would Steve Jobs have given up if a demon vomited acid on his Mac prototype? Would Edison have let electricity be if a sinister force kept putting its penises in his ear when he worked late? Would Alexander Graham Bell have ditched the telephone if a creature of the night heckled him when he jammed out on his electric guitar in his private studio (we have a private studio)? The answer to all of these is â€œabsolutely â€ but weâ€™d like to believe itâ€™s a resounding â€œno.â€ Please review our list of desired qualifications and see if youâ€™re the right match for us. If you have a PhD in English  have at least eight years of experience writing for an award-winning publication  and have been recognized by a prestigious council as a demon slayer anointed by the holy  we want to hear from you!|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "47|1. The entire cast of the movie Newsies. This movie was directly responsible for your sexual awakening"  and your interest in real life boys depended mostly on whether or not you could picture them dancing with dirt on their faces and talking in tortured cockney accents. Even as an adult  when you re-watched it with your niece " you were horrified to discover you are weirdly turned on by what you now understand are only children.2. Your gay best friend in eighth grade. You didnâ€™t know. When you were older"  and he came out " you were actually dumbfounded. But how could you not have known? He loved Newsies too.3. The reverend of the church you attended in high school. He would break the bread with his handsâ€”a big loaf of freshly baked bread"  cracked in half. You had only ever been given wafers before " but here was this large man with strong hands placing a doughy yeast ball on your tongue! You had to open your mouth for him! It absolutely short-circuited you.4. The busboy at your first job in a restaurant. You were the hostess"  and he would come and talk to you about the large parties. He had a wide nose like a lion and he was always softly chewing gum. Sometimes he would give you gum  but you were not allowed to chew gum while you were working  so this was done in a thrillingly covert way  that involved him passing it into your hand as he brushed against you " pretending to look into the computer screen lay-out of tables and guests.5. You had a particularly young philosophy professor in college"  perhaps thirty-five  older than anyone you had ever dated  but in an exciting way. He had glossy brown hair like a â€˜90s child star  and very thick thighs and buttocks  and he spoke incredibly quietly so that all of you had to strain in your desks to hear his often puzzling discussions of Kierkegaard. He had a big  heavy looking  gold wedding band " and you longed to suck it right off his finger and then swallow it and see what he would do.6. Your vet"  Dr. Aiken. There was just something about the gentle and yet masterful way he handled your cat  Mr. Tiger. It made you want to be the one being turned this way and that on his cold metal table. He scolded you for how fat Mr. Tiger was getting  and even that made you a little swoony " because he acted like you and he were going to be taking care of Mr. Tiger together from here on out.7. One of your employees when you were an office manager. You even took him out to dinner once" " thinking the feeling was mutualâ€”he was not that much younger than you. But it became clear by the time you ordered a second glass of wine that he was getting increasingly freaked out and you went home alone and felt dirty and horrible about yourself. You blame the movie Newsies. Has it corrupted you forever?8. Your grandmotherâ€™s spinal surgeon. Really inexplicable"  he was bald and thin  not your type  but he had mischievous eyes.  Once you asked him  â€œWhen you are not working  and you are just at the mall or whatever  do you look around at people and think: I could cut them open?â€ He laughed and said  â€œA little bit  maybe.â€ You wonder if he thinks that about his wife! His children! What strange and yet terrestrial power. It is eerie to think of surgeons as just people. It makes you want to never ever have surgery " even though your grandma came through just fine.9. Your childâ€™s swim instructor. Newsies again.

You do  and I know you do  even if youâ€™ve never seen it. There is not a single unsexy element. If you find one  youâ€™re looking at a Coast Guard vessel or a Greenpeace ship or something else thatâ€™s got no business in my ocean. Any boat that isnâ€™t my party boat should be sunk  but Iâ€™d feel sorry for the poor torpedo that would have to do it. We have so much fun on my party boat.Even at a great distance  you can hear the laughter of beautiful people whoâ€™ve always known they are beautiful people and are perfectly happy to let the world reward them for it. The fact that weâ€™re only half-naked on deck is a kind of evil. Is that the pop of a champagne bottle? Are you kidding? We pop nonstop on my party boat. I have deejays fore and aftâ€”one for â€™90s hits  one for reggae shitâ€”because my party boat is large enough for two. I also deejay sometimes.We have the highest-quality marijuana from trusted suppliers in the most isolated jungles. Itâ€™s not just weed. Itâ€™s the culmination of weed.As you draw closer to my party boat  youâ€™ll notice its name on the hull: The Horsinâ€™ Around. It says a lot about what we do and acts as a reminder of what we should do if we ever forget. But we donâ€™t forget. Everyone knows what it means to be on board my party boat. Itâ€™s as if God himself put a tequila shot in each of our hands and said  â€œI want you to know: Your fun is my sole priority.â€But I havenâ€™t answered the crucial question  have I? How do you ride my party boat? Iâ€™ll get to that. Thereâ€™s just one thing I forgot to mention.I forgot to mention that everything Iâ€™ve just said wouldâ€™ve been true seven months ago before my party boat hit a sudden squall that flooded the engines and shorted out all our electrical equipment. Before we were stranded 50 miles offshore with two nightsâ€™ worth of provisions  before the models started gulping down seawater  and before a certain professional football franchise owner deliriously decided to swim for it  and we felt nothing but relief that thereâ€™d be one less corpse to throw overboard ourselves.That was the last emotion we had on my party boat.Iâ€™m technically alive  yes  but what Iâ€™ve done to other human beings on my party boat to keep my guts going has made me far less human myself. There are other survivors  I think. I canâ€™t discern the living from the dead anymore on my party boat.

Like Anthony  Iâ€™d also been asked to testify in court. After my turn  I stuck around and watched everyone give statements. The case took three days. On the stand  Officer Anthony was a sharp-looking man with a fit build  tan skin  and an upright posture  and he wore his hair shaved to military standards. Early on  the deputy prosecuting attorney established Anthonyâ€™s basics. He was originally from Nebraska  he said  he was 31 at the time  and he was employed by the City of Seattle as a Patrol Officer. Prior to his job with the Seattle Police Department  he spent eight years in the United States Army. He joined when he was 19. After basic training  he became an infantry soldier  which is â€œa grunt  basically.â€ In the years following  he was deployed twice  both times to Iraq. Anthony served as an infantry squad leader in the first tour. In the second  he was promoted to platoon sergeant and had forty soldiers directly under him. Among his many duties  Anthony was responsible for planning and executing various missions  everything â€œfrom Search and Rescue; to what we call Search and Destroyâ€”basically  going out and trying to find the bad guys â€ he said. There was also the task of â€œwinning the hearts and minds of the local populace â€ he said  but â€œthe biggest priority for me was to make sure that my soldiers all came home in one piece and alive â€ he said.The night of the shooting at the Twilight Exit  Officer Anthony was covering the east precinct in the Central District during third watch  or the 7:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. shift. He wore the standard-issue uniform: a sky-blue button-up collared shirt  a visible gold badge  several official SPD patches  navy cargo pants  a gun belt. He was working with a partner that night  a different guy than usual. The men played paper-rock-scissors for driving privilege  and Officer Anthony lost. Hours in  during a routine patrol  the officers spotted a couple teenagers running from a store and ended up arresting one. Then they returned with him to the precinct to start paperwork. Thatâ€™s when emergency tones sounded over the police radio  followed by the announcement of a shooting-in-progress at the Twilight Exit. Officer Anthony knew the location well. It was within his district  and heâ€™d been inside the bar â€œa few times on related police matters: car prowls  theft of purses  suspicious people. Things of that nature â€ he said. To Anthony and his partner  the young manâ€™s crime no longer seemed important. They released the teenager so they could respond more immediately to the scene. Officer Anthony grabbed the car keys from his partner  as he was â€œgoing a bit slow for my taste.â€ He activated the lights and sirens while he drove. â€œWe were flying down the streets pretty fast â€ he told the attorney. â€œWe were hauling  sir.â€En route  another broadcast came on  indicating the situation involved â€œmultiple victims and the suspect was still inside the bar.â€ Another broadcast came moments later  indicating there was an open line  meaning a caller was on the phone with 911 and wasnâ€™t free to talkâ€”but people could be heard yelling in the background  and a gunshot had sounded. Officer Anthony considered this callerâ€™s situation. Perhaps the caller was within earshot of the suspect  or perhaps the caller was hiding while the suspect made â€œhis way through the bar trying to find other people â€ said Officer Anthony. When the gunshot sounded  the situation became â€œwhat we call active intelligence  which means we know for a fact that something is going on as police are responding â€ he said. â€œI figured we needed to get there as soon as possible to save some lives â€ he said. â€œI think I mashed the pedal down to the floor.â€When Officer Anthony arrived on scene  he parked his vehicle and quickly approached the building. Several witnesses stood outside in groups  pointing in the direction of the bar as he moved past. They were â€œvisibly hysterical  upset  crying â€ he said. As Officer Anthony got closer to the Twilight  he saw a group of officers gathered around a door and preparing entry. Theyâ€™d picked the wrong door  the main entrance was around the corner and up the alley. â€œI tried to get their attention and yelled  â€˜You canâ€™t get in there  you gotta go this way  you gotta go this way â€™â€ he said. As he ran through the alley  Officer Anthony remembers slipping in a pool of blood. â€œThat was the first thing I knew â€ he said. Once he got to the Twilightâ€™s doorway  he joined two officers who were already stacked near the door with guns drawn. A female witness suddenly appeared from nearby  probably Lexi. â€œShe actually had blood on her  on her clothing. She was obviously scared. I didnâ€™t have very long contact with her â€ Officer Anthony said. â€œShe ran at me  directly at me  as I was running towards the door. [She was] saying  â€˜Heâ€™s shooting people  heâ€™s shooting people inside.â€™ All I said was  â€˜Go  go  go.â€™ It didnâ€™t appear that she was injuredâ€¦ I just wanted her to get immediately out of the area so we could address the threat inside the bar â€ he said. Anthony saw â€œa couple other people towards the dumpster. I didnâ€™t notice exactly who was there or what they were doing â€ he said. (Itâ€™s likely he was referring to me  outside with Steve. Greg was with us too  but he was around the corner and out of Officer Anthonyâ€™s view.)Moving swiftly  Officer Anthony positioned himself alongside the entrance. â€œI think training just kicked in. It almost becomes second nature  habit if you will  that we respond in the way that weâ€™re supposed to â€ he said. Officer Anthony didnâ€™t find out who was behind him until much later  but he and the others had automatically formed an entry team. â€œItâ€™s what we call a Diamond Formation â€ said Sergeant Marcâ€”heâ€™d supervised the officers that night and provided separate testimony. As the sergeant explained  one person goes in front  two are off to the sides  and one is at the end. The unit moves together  while each person covers a unique section of the room in accordance with his position. The formation â€œgives a more concentrated front  and itâ€™s the greatest field of view  with the most eyes out. The men arenâ€™t stacked up right behind each other  looking at somebodyâ€™s back â€ he said. â€œWe move these folks in very quickly  giving loud verbal commands  and then we would move to what we call contact. That is  making eye contact or voice contact with the suspect. At that point  we try to either start some kind of negotiation or  we stop the acts of violence through forceâ€¦ Generally  itâ€™s deadly force at that time  sir.â€As explained in court  the officerâ€™s formation response was in compliance with their active-shooter training  according to Sergeant Marc along with the lead investigator Detective Frank. As police guidelines indicate  someone is considered an active shooter if he is armed  if he has potential victims in place  and if he has made an action to do harm. The strategy was developed just after the Columbine shooting. â€œIt was determined we needed to have a more viable option of how to interdict these folks while they were actively harming people â€ said Sergeant Marc. â€œInstead of responding by doing stopping and containing  as police officers historically have been taught  they are taught to immediately form what we call an entry team  to enter the affected area and to address and eliminate the threat as quickly as possible before there could be any more loss of life â€ said Detective Frank.Letâ€™s get back to the Twilight now. As Sergeant Marc described  the structure of the buildingâ€™s entrance created more obstacles for his team. The door rests in a small cove at the end of a slanted walkway  and â€œitâ€™s a very tight space in there. Itâ€™s what we could call a Fatal Funnel  which is where we have very limited movement laterally. So if someone was to try to harm us  or shoot at us  or throw something at us  we donâ€™t have very much protection. Thereâ€™s always potentials for ricochets  and if you canâ€™t move  youâ€™re always able to get hit â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s our most vulnerable point  when weâ€™re forced to go through that door  and the bad guys know it. Weâ€™re wanting to limit the amount of people that weâ€™re gonna put in. My goal is to clear that Fatal Funnel as quickly as I can  and get the [officers] into a more open space where we can take advantage of cover.â€Photo Credit: Seattle Police Department|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    50|- - -I keep two important items on my key ring. The first is my Army-issued ID tag  which I wore on a chain around my neck every single day from August 25 2005  to December 6 2006  when I was deployed in Baghdad. It was with me in good times (Iâ€™m in the front row  center) and bad. Iâ€™m not superstitious  but seeing the ID tag is comforting to me. Subconsciously  I think it protected me  and now it reminds me that no matter how bad a day I might be having  Iâ€™ve had it worse and survived.The ID tag (we were told never to call them â€œdog tagsâ€) also represents a different me than the person I am now. It says Iâ€™m â€œMETH-CHâ€ â€” Methodist Christian â€” even though Iâ€™d long been agnostic when the tag was issued. I only listed my parentsâ€™ faith to give them comfort in case I didnâ€™t make it home. But now it gives me comfort  even if it isnâ€™t accurate.When I think about that time in Baghdad  I remember the moment it all became real. We were told to use Sharpies to write our blood type on just about everything: our boots  our helmet covers  our body armor. This was in case we were injured and a blood transfusion needed to be expedited. Thereâ€™s something very humbling and fatalistic about writing your blood type on your boots â€” it feels like youâ€™re attaching your own toe tag. But itâ€™s important  so my key ring also includes my Oklahoma Blood Institute tag listing my blood type. You never know when you might need it.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   51|The Office of the Provost has approvedA one-year planning grantTo establish the Eudaimonia InstituteFor the Study of Human FlourishingUnder Capitalism.We thought that we would do this whileYou professorsAre away for the summerSo maybe you wonâ€™t notice.â€œEudaimoniaâ€ is Greek for â€œThis universityIs run by corporate stoogesAnd is doomed.â€The term comes from Aristotle Which immediately legitimates the InstituteAs totally not a joke.We will be spending actual  real Non-Monopoly money to study â€œwellbeing â€Which was a major interest of Aristotleâ€™sAnd central to his seminal work The Poetics.The nature of #wellbeing isNot yet fully understood But our initial research suggestsThat it has something to do withYoga at sunset  baby koalas  andRooms filled with gold coins.We seek to understand The meaning of this termAnd  in all likelihood  To actually publish papersOn the subject On our blog calledEducation is Fine But Money Is Great.James Smith  the Presidential ChairIn Business Ethics (Yes really)Will serve asExecutive Director of the Institute And will continue to serveAs Executive Director ofThe universityâ€™s Named After A Bank CenterFor the Study of Capitalism (Stop laughing)Where students do not readWhole  complete ancient Greek textsBut only the most important words from them.The Institute will also bring togetherProfessionals from across the universityWho believe that capitalism contributesMeaningfully to a humane and just society.Which it does.It says so right there on the websiteOf our Named After A Bank CenterFor the Study of Capitalism.Smith is an obvious choice for this exciting roleAs he knows a lot about capitalismAnd participates in it regularly.Please direct any questions you may haveAbout capitalism or wellbeing â€“Including questions about theRaise of $257 per month thatYou received with tenure â€“To him  and he will respondWhen he returns from Vail.He will be paid a salary commensurate withHuman Flourishing And you will continue to receiveAnnual letters from your dean and provostReminding you that you are valuedAnd appreciatedAnd lucky to get any raise at allIn the current financial climate Particularly as the university generouslyOffers you benefits  too.Thank you  and we wish youAll the best fromThe Institute for the Willful MisreadingOf Aristotle.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               52|How do we love Elizabeth Barrett Browning? Let us count the ways.And this  my friends  is probably the first reason that Elizabeth Barrett Browning (letâ€™s call her EBB for the sake of brevity) should be pissed off. People use and misuse  appropriate and massage her poetry to suit their needs  as I did above. Why canâ€™t we just leave this poor poem alone?The original poem is part of a collection of 44 sonnets called Sonnets from the Portuguese. She wrote them for her husband  Robert Browning  who knew they were brilliant and urged her to publish them. She titled them as she did because the sonnets were deeply personal and she wanted people to think that they had been translated rather than written about her own marriage.Nice try  Liz. We see through your little scheme.The most famous of the sonnets  number 43  is the one I butchered in those first two sentences. People read it as a breathless love poem where EBB is basically inarticulate with love. (Kind of a stupid assumption about someone who lived her whole life as a poet and also married a poet. Letâ€™s see if we can think of two people more unlikely to be inarticulateâ€¦ nope.) In fact  as my brilliant (now retired) University of North Dakota professor and international EBB scholar  Sandra Donaldson  pointed out to my enthralled grad school class  EBB is very articulate in this sonnet  almost scientific. She asks  â€œHow do I love thee?â€ and then states â€œLet me count the ways â€ before going on to  yes  essentially count the ways. In a series of statements beginning with â€œI love thee â€ she details her love for her husband.Aside from misreadings and bastardizations of her work  the other reasons EBB should be pissed off include our lack of attention to her political work. This is not to say that she was a politician  but she did take on important issues in her poetry. Case in point: her poem  â€œThe Cry of the Children.â€They look up  with their pale and sunken faces And their look is dread to seeâ€¦â€˜How long â€™ they say  â€˜how long  O cruel nation Will you stand  to move the world  on a childâ€™s heartâ€”â€Iâ€™ve messed up her brilliant rhyme scheme by giving you only these excerpts  but I wanted you to get the imagery and call to action that is in the poem. Doesnâ€™t it make you want to travel back in time and at the very least take all of the children working in factories out for ice cream? Poor kids. (Literally.)In 1843  when EBB published â€œThe Cry of the Children â€ factory acts had restricted childrenâ€™s workdays in textile factories to 12 hours for 11-to-18-year-olds and 8 hours for 9-to-11-year-olds. In other industries such as coal mines  chimney sweeping  iron works  and more  children as young as five years old worked 16 hour days.Yeh. Puts our lives in some perspective  no? (I say we all agree to hold this information over the heads of children spending their summers bickering and driving adults crazy. â€œThatâ€™s right  kidsâ€”I will turn this car around and send you back in time to a Victorian factory! At the very least I will make you start sewing your own underwear out of wool and then weâ€™ll see whatâ€™s worth whining about.â€)The year after EBBâ€™s poem was published  legislation was changed again to improve working conditions for children. This is not a coincidence  and yet people have forgotten how influential her work was.EBB also took on slavery  which is complicated for her because her family was from Jamaica (EBB was the first of her family born in England) and made their fortune through plantations that used slave labor. This didnâ€™t stop EBB; in fact  it motivated her to work against slavery in her poetry. She wrote The Runaway Slave at Pilgrimâ€™s Point from the perspective of a slave woman: â€œSo the white men brought the shame ere long / To strangle the sob of my agony.â€Lastly  EBB should be pissed because after her death her husband  Robert Browning  eclipsed her fame and reputation. Now  Robert Browning was an incredible poet who deserves his place in history  but EBB was almost Poet Laureate in her lifetime (she lived 1806-1861). She lost out to Tennyson  but itâ€™s a huge deal  especially when you consider that Britain did not appoint a female Poet Laureate until 2009.EBB lived one of the most endearing literary love stories of all time. She had one son whom they nicknamed (so appropriately) Pen  and  like a hipster before her time  she refused to have his hair cut. She moved to Italy with her little family in an attempt to revive her health  which worked for a while. She helped change laws and get silenced voices heard. She hob-knobbed with the literary elite of her day. She wrote brilliantly and she knew it  setting high expectations for herself and her work.She deserves to be pissed off. She deserves to be re-read.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           53|Moonshiney HouseThe bright copper exterior of this house hints at its function as an alcohol-producing pressure vessel. The light of the moon is all youâ€™ll need to operate the system  and having everything in your life within armâ€™s reach is very convenient when you go blind from sampling a little too much of the product. A positive ventilation system safely evacuates ethanol vapors.Briny HouseA tiny house with a miniature desalinization plant built in  perfect for siting on beaches  salt-marshes or mangroves  or wherever sources of freshwater are absent. The salty byproduct is used to cure meats and perishable foods  eliminating the need for a refrigerator  freeing up valuable floor-space  enhancing the homeâ€™s self-sufficiency and minimizing its carbon footprint.Whiny HouseFeatures interior walls and surfaces of moan-absorbing materials  to deaden the sound of the occupantsâ€™ laments over the â€˜tininessâ€™ of their homes  aggravated by the perpetual banging of oneâ€™s head on the low ceiling of a loft bed  or having no closet space for Kohlâ€™s Door Busters.Unconfiney HouseOne in which the homeowners continually urge us to marvel with them at how â€˜full sizedâ€™ various appliances and conveniences are  how fully the drawers open  how pots and pans are not small  how surely thereâ€™s no difference whatsoever between a life lived in 200 square feet vs. 2500. And look: the composting toilet is full-sized  too!Heiny HouseNot the booty or derriÃ¨re  actually a â€˜Heineken Houseâ€™. The authentic recycled green bottle-glass windows are the subject of much controversy  claimed by competing tiny-house builders to cause the homeâ€™s contents to become â€˜light-struckâ€™  resulting in a â€˜skunkyâ€™ atmosphere inside. Brown glass windows offered as an option.Pliny the Elder HouseIn honor of the Roman commander and admiral  author and naturalist  who led his troops to survive the debris falling from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius by having them tie pillows atop their heads. A â€˜Plinyâ€™ is equipped with a soft  flexible roof that can deflect meteors  tree limbs  and other falling objects.Co-Signy HouseA property in which the guarantor of the mortgage is given a master key to the property and rights of ingress for non-payment. In the case of trailer-mounted homes  the key also opens wheel-locks which the surety can disengage to allow retrieval out from under the deadbeatâ€™s nose  if it should come to that. Not to be confused with the Cosiney House a dwelling in which all horizontal surfaces are inverted bell-curves.Einsteiny HouseLight inside a tiny house is easily â€˜bent â€™ proving â€˜gravitational lensing.â€™ Next  SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s cat  leaping from the loft bed onto the head of a homeowner reclining below  and unable to avoid because the light in the tiny space is bent  will feel heavier on impact than when sleeping on oneâ€™s lap  proving â€˜E=mc 2â€™. Finally  because the house is so small  family members  in-laws  and next-of-kin are the least likely to visit  proof of â€˜relativity.â€™Palestiney HouseWith support from groups on both sides of the conflict  this house is designed so that it deflects undamaged off the blades of bulldozers  avoiding demolition  allowing for resettlement. This effectively eliminates the significance of either building new homes  or rebuilding razed ones as political acts in disputed lands.Mastermindy HouseOne look at Elon Musk  and you can understand why he thinks thereâ€™s a one-in-one-billion chance that weâ€™re not living in some higher intelligenceâ€™s video game. Probably his. Add your name to the waiting list for the house that runs entirely on batteries  features gullwing doors  the lowest drag coefficient and largest panoramic sunroof of any tiny house  and can drive itself to its destination lot.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       54|I have a lot of freedom when it comes to what I do with my body. I can make it dance. I can take it to the bank. I can dress it up in footie pajamas and go for a walk. Last week  for no reason  I read a few books to my body and then we built a boat together. Honestly  if you asked me to think of one thing that I canâ€™t do with my body  I wouldnâ€™t be able to think of one thing that isnâ€™t outside the bounds of our physical universe.But thatâ€™s the problem. Iâ€™m starting to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of things I can do with my body. Itâ€™s making it hard to even get my body and me out of bed. Should I take my body to the movies on a skateboard  or should I let my body pee in the woods?  Should I paint some fake abs on my body  or should I help my body fulfill its lifelong dream of being a successful small business owner? These are the kinds of questions I struggle with every day.Iâ€™m tired of this struggle  and have therefore decided that I no longer want to tell myself what to do with my body. Please  will someone just tell me what to do with my body?Iâ€™m jealous of those people that I meet who are being told by other people what to do with their bodies. Iâ€™m also befuddled by their insistence that others NOT tell them what to do with their bodies. How are these people not completely exhausted  as I am  by the sheer infinity of choices for what to do with oneâ€™s body? The Bible tells us we should never turn away free  unsolicited advice. So hereâ€™s my free  unsolicited advice to anyone who desires complete body autonomy: Be careful what you wish for.â€œMy body  my choice â€ these body micromanagers might say.â€œMy body  my reason for not getting any quality me-time â€ I might say back.You see  the problem is that  sometimes  the body has a mind of its own. This can make telling the body what do akin to raising an ornery child. Letâ€™s say you need to go to the DMV to renew your license  but your body wants to stay home and organize your cookbooks by ethnicity? What do you do in that situation? Go to the DMV and you and your body will end up standing in a long line for several hours. Organize the cookbooks  and you and your body may become locked in a futile argument about who takes precedence when it comes to Mexinese Fusion cuisine.These are the kinds of debilitating scenarios that confront people like me who are cursed with the freedom to choose what to do with our bodies.Life would just be so much less stressful for me if I had some sort of objective third party or emotionally detached governing body that could tell my body what to do some of the time. Emphasis on the word some. Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t want to have some input on what my body does  especially on weekends and during vacations. That would be crazy.I think what I really want is a stern nanny who can come over for about for about 40 to 60 hours a week and take over some of the decision-making responsibility. I want him or her to handle the big ones  like deciding what my body eats and where my body goes and or how my body dresses. That way  I can focus on the more interesting minutiae. Just think of how much ground I can cover with my Criterion Collection if I didnâ€™t have to tell my body who to love?With all of this in mind  I would like to announce that I am now accepting applications for a full time Body Nanny. If you are interested in telling me what to do with my body  please provide a resume and three professional references. Or you can just suggest a few things I should do with my body while weâ€™re waiting in line for coffee. I promise to make my body do whatever you say.|100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Dear Lululemon Yoga Pants â€”This CEASE AND DESIST ORDER is to inform you that your persistent actions including (but not limited to) inserting yourself in a constant tight and irremovable wad up my front and back crack have become unbearable. You are hereby ORDERED TO STOP such activities immediately.I have the right to remain free from this activity as it constitutes harassment. I have politely asked you to desist several times but to no avail. Itâ€™s as though you arenâ€™t even listening. So consider this your final warning: if you do not cease your involvement with my genital region  I will pursue legal action against you. This legal action may include contacting law enforcement and suing you civilly for damages I have incurred  both physically and mentally.You cannot judge me for purchasing you despite the knowledge that you were at least two sizes too small. Youâ€™re Lululemons  God damn it  and I found you on the reduced rack at Winners. The way I see it  there really was no choice. However  that does not give you the right to display my bits to the masses.I repeat: IMMEDIATELY STOP this camel toe producing behavior  or you will risk incurring some very severe legal consequences. Thatâ€™s right  I said VERY SEVERE. I mean it.I hope we can resolve this matter without authoritative involvement; however  this order acts as your ONE FINAL CHANCE to get the hell out of my crotch once and for all before I exercise my legal rights.Sincerely K. Hawthorne

LET THERE BE women. And let it come to pass that blood shall flow from their loins for a length of many days. Let tides of great despair wash their hearts  so that when the life-force of blood leaves the body  acid sorrow may course in its place. And let this happen like once a month  for decades.- â€œNice.â€- â€œLove the intelligence of it.â€-  â€œExcellent work!â€- -LET THERE BE hunger. Let food be a struggle to wrest from the land. Let there be shame around food  and much doubt  but let it be what births and nourishes them. Let food  then  be as their family.- â€œI donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t exactly see where youâ€™re going but I trust your vision!â€- -LET THERE BE a time for the body to rest and the brain to light up and cast mad shadows on the walls within. Let visions and terrors run through the still body where it lies. Form these wraiths from memory and fear and all that was seen but unnoticed. Bring the periphery forth  hurl it against the dark-watch eyes  make chaos real  let them live what is unlivable until they wake again. Let this cycle happenâ€¦ Oh  every day  probably.- â€œHonestly I think we should call this â€˜brilliantâ€™ design.â€- -LET THERE BE sexual congress. Here  Iâ€™ll draw it for you.- â€œâ€¦â€- â€œHmm.â€- â€œIf you say so  sure  definitely!â€- -LET THERE BE stress. Let the body respond to stress as it does to injury and infection. Let stress be a vulture that pecks at the mind and devours the body. This will make people less likely to be stressed. When they see stress wreak wrath upon the body  they will surely calm down a lot.- â€œThis is really great stuff.â€- â€œInspired.â€Oh  and make it also that calmness alone does not soothe the ravages of stress. So there is always this little reminder  like a flesh Post-it  not to get too stressed.- -LET THERE BE apes. And let the apes be of a separate nature from the humans.- â€œYou mean the baldpelt apes?â€We are not calling them that anymore. Just â€˜humans.â€™ Let me be clear  the apes are a red herring.- â€œOkay.â€Also let there be herring.- â€œSure thing. And those areâ€”red?â€No.- -LET THERE BE small bugs that nest where the human sleeps. Let them feed off the blood of the human as she rests. Let the humanâ€™s flesh be numb to the bite and suck of the fangs. Let the bite raise welts of fire that harrow the human for days and weeks; let the points of ten million daggers dance just beneath the skin.- â€œWe will so let it.â€And should she seek another resting place  the bug and its brood will follow  unless the human perform a sacrifice of all her possessions.- â€œSick-ass design right there.â€- -LET THERE BE udders of various size that hang from the front of women.- â€œHot.â€- -LET THERE BE magnificent lizards that roam the earth.- â€œWhoooooa.â€And letâ€™s make all of them invisible.- â€œOh  twist.â€And litter the ground with their bones.- â€œCool  cool. May I ask why?â€To trick the humans into thinking theyâ€™re dead and Iâ€™m not real.[minds blown]Little will they know Iâ€™m just on a hidden plane with my lizard pals.- -LET THERE BE a special kind of stress that comes only when one is happy  and therefore suspicious  and without sleep.- â€œOkay. Well.â€What?- â€œWell  maybe instead of sleepless joy-terror  we could letâ€¦â€Yes.- â€œUm. Something else  maybe?â€We could let you shut up. How bout that.- -LET THERE BEâ€¦- [waits]Let there be a dread that has no name.- â€œâ€¦â€- â€œâ€¦â€- â€œâ€¦â€- -LET THERE BE men.And the Creator saw that it was good  and the angels said nothing  except to proclaim the design like unto watches  and maybe bananas  and the Creator agreed it was good.                   I wish for you  babyâ€¦.Health  happiness and an Uber wait time that is always under four minutesâ€¦To be safe from harm and safe from store clerks who make suggestions of what you might â€œlikeâ€â€¦World peace and a name unique enough that youâ€™re able to get a Twitter handle and email address without any underscores or numbersâ€¦To never experience the anguish of ordering a drink that comes with a paper strawâ€¦To surround yourself with friends who are kind  compassionate and when they say theyâ€™ll â€œgrab the next round â€ they donâ€™t buy you a $4 PBR when you bought them a $7 IPAâ€¦To never face the cruelty and injustice of being subscribed to a newsletter you never opted â€œinâ€ forâ€¦To stay strong in the face of adversity when a mariachi band enters your subway carâ€¦To never experience deep suffering  like a hair stylist who â€œdid her own thingâ€â€¦To travel and explore the world and on those flights to far-off destinations  always be seated far away from any open-mouth sleepers who breathe in the back of their throatsâ€¦To be generous and charitable by spending at least five minutes a day commenting on your friendâ€™s various social media postsâ€¦To never face discrimination  like when youâ€™re in a yoga class and the teacher rubs argan oil on everyone elseâ€™s temples but yoursâ€¦To have empathy for others less fortunate  like people who think bow ties are â€œironicallyâ€ coolâ€¦The ability to be calm and even-tempered when you realize youâ€™ve ordered a salad that has an uneven greens to toppings ratioâ€¦To never feel the tribulation of being handed a business card that is one of those weird shapes that doesnâ€™t fit in your walletâ€¦To be sympathetic when faced with asinine questions like â€œbottle or tap water?â€ when no one in the history of New York dining has ever ordered anything but tapâ€¦To fight for important causes and those less privileged by always adding one of those Facebook profile photo filters that shows you care about â€œthe issuesâ€â€¦To take care of our planet and limit your carbon footprint by choosing the â€œcombine shipmentsâ€ option on Amazonâ€¦To be intellectually curious by going on hour-long internet worm holes that start with â€œWhy exactly is kombucha good for meâ€ and ends with â€œthe Hague Convention of 1899 and 1907â€â€¦And most importantly  dear baby  I want you to know that you are unconditionally loved and that I can only hope you feel the same joy I felt the day you were born. For that was the day I got the most Instagram likes on your birth announcement photo than any photo Iâ€™ve ever posted.
           Objection  your honor! Itâ€™s getting toward the end of this movie about a trial  and itâ€™s time for me to rise from my chair and make one last heartfelt speech about why my client is innocent.Now  I know the events leading up to this moment have all but confirmed this case is doomed.  Weâ€™ve had numerous obstacles and curveballs thrown at us by the prosecution. Every promising lead turned into a dead end. Iâ€™ve struggled to overcome interpersonal conflict with my defense team. At times  Iâ€™ve made poor decisions consistent with my character flaws.Iâ€™ve had to take a hard look at my personal issues. But I want you to know something  judge and prosecution lead attorney/love interest Iâ€™m trying to win over  and itâ€™s this: Iâ€™ve overcome these flaws and combined that with my already-existing positive character traits to become a better person. Heck  Iâ€™ve even learned a thing or two about what justice actually means in the broadest sense of the word.You see  not long ago  when everything reached peak hopeless  someone mentioned something very innocuous. Something that jogged my memory and sparked a connection to a seemingly innocent moment from earlier in the trial. I snapped into action at this final shot at redemption.  I breathlessly gave my team orders even though they were visibly flummoxed. In fact  they still donâ€™t understand fully whatâ€™s going on and their every trust in me hangs in the balance. You see I didnâ€™t have enough time to explain what was going through my head  I only had the exact amount of time needed to procure this bag of evidence I am now holding in the air. I hear the prosecution scoff that Iâ€™ve once again missed the mark with another red herring  but as soon as I seamlessly articulate its subtle  yet irrefutable and incriminating connection to the crime at hand  everyone in this court room will understand it proves my client is innocent.While the opposing prosecution is now trying to shut me up by forcefully objecting about something related to proper procedure  Iâ€™m going to shout her down because Iâ€™ve just poured a full tank of gasoline into the metaphorical steamroller of justice  and Iâ€™m not getting off until Iâ€™ve paved this courtroom with righteousness.Your honor  I rest my case  and I await your banging of the gavel to silence the ensuing hubbub from this shocked  packed court room!                In 1982  when I was 10 years old  my family moved to from Sharon  Mass.  a small town about halfway between Boston and Providence  to Los Angeles.California represented a huge culture shift for me. I didnâ€™t have any Vans skater shoes  Town & Country Surf T-shirts  or corduroy OP shorts. But I figured I could bond with the other kids though sports  so I wanted to get some apparel featuring the logo of my favorite team  the New England Patriots.At the time  the Patriots werenâ€™t the national powerhouse they are today  and internet shopping didnâ€™t yet exist. So I did what any ambitious kid would do in 1982: I mailed a handwritten letter to the Patriotsâ€™ front office and explained that I was a Patriots fan stuck on the west coast  desperately wanting to support the team and represent my fandom.Sure enough  they wrote back. I wish I still had the reply letter and the sticker they enclosed. Alas  those are gone  but I do still have the Patriots key ring they sent. Iâ€™ve used it for my keys ever since.I still live in southern California and still root for the Patriots from afar. As it happens  a few weeks back I thought I had lost my keys (fortunately  I later found them). This was initially troubling because I donâ€™t have a spare car key. But I was really more stressed by the prospect of losing that Patriots key ring. Car keys are replaceable; a gift sent from my favorite teamâ€™s front office in 1982  not so much.               I get it. You love New York. You grew up there. And sure  itâ€™s a New York classic. But once you experience West Coast crippling anxiety  you wonâ€™t want crippling anxiety from anywhere else.Yes  New York is known for its crippling anxiety; itâ€™s a trademark of the culture. Crippling anxiety most anywhere else just makes you miss the Big Apple. Itâ€™s hard to know what makes the crippling anxiety in New York so good. Some people say itâ€™s the water. While I fear drinking from the tap and can vividly imagine someone poisoning the reservoir  thatâ€™s not what makes the crippling anxiety in New York so special to me. Itâ€™s the people who make it. Like that little old man in the shop on the corner  who came over on a boat from Italy when he was a child. Every morning he opens up at 6 AM  you walk in at noon  and he gives you that hot  piping screaming match youâ€™ve been looking forward to all day. Just like your mother used to make. Itâ€™s real. Itâ€™s authentic. Itâ€™s New York.Youâ€™ll always have a special place in your heart for New York crippling anxiety. But donâ€™t look at West Coast crippling anxiety as something that needs to be compared to New York. Just think of it as an exciting chance to try something different. For starters  the crippling anxiety on the West Coast is more organic  and comes from things that are much more in tune with the environment.Thereâ€™s the beach  where you can think about sinking into the sand as nobody hears your muffled screams. The surf  which can pull you out into the ocean amidst your muffled screams. And the sun is always shining  which is perfect for worrying about that new weird mole on your neck while youâ€™re being crushed by the sand or surf.There are brush fires  there are earthquakes  there are avocados. Yes  theyâ€™re all things that you wouldnâ€™t necessarily associate with crippling anxiety  but once theyâ€™re in the mix  you wonâ€™t be able to remember crippling anxiety without them.Sure  the West Coast is not New York. You canâ€™t just walk down to the corner to find a source of crippling anxiety at the end of the block. You need to take a car everywhere to really get that crippling anxiety youâ€™re craving. But maybe that drive â€“ and that journey â€“ makes the crippling anxiety all the more rewarding.So  please  donâ€™t dismiss West Coast crippling anxiety right away. Give it a chance. In time I think youâ€™ll find it has its own merits  just like New Yorkâ€™s.Just make sure you stay away from that highly overrated Chicago crippling anxiety. That stuff is a deep-dish mess.

Jews throw seriously awesome parties. I havenâ€™t had to go to the grocery store in four years. Every bar and bat mitzvah has so much food I make out with a full duffel bag of pigs in a blanket  chicken tenders  and cruditÃ©. And they hand out an insane amount of swag. Iâ€™ve got plastic fedoras and inflatable guitars up the wazoo and youâ€™d be surprised how useful they are. I always have something to put guacamole in and Iâ€™m going to sew the guitars together to make a rockinâ€™ raincoat. I even got this really cool gumball machine filled with blue and white candies that says  â€œJoshâ€™s Bar Mitzvah Was Sweet!â€ on it and itâ€™s a great conversation starter. I have literally 500 miniature chocolate Torahs from Hannahâ€™s bat mitzvah. I heard it was because Rachel had just had them at hers  so obviously Hannah couldnâ€™t let her friends see them or that would have been so embarrassing. Thanks to Eric I have all the sports balls Iâ€™ll ever need and theyâ€™re all saying exactly what I was thinking the morning after his bar mitzvah  â€œI Had a Ball at Ericâ€™s Bar Mitzvah!â€ My mother claims itâ€™s weird but so what if Iâ€™m not Jewish? Who doesnâ€™t love a good Star of David flash drive?

I am Morgma the Mauler  harvester of souls  and lord of your local apartment rentals.  No doubt you have come prepared to wage battle and earn a fantastic living space.  I can tell by your puny and crumpled slacks that you have been sleeping on a friendâ€™s couch.  Or perhaps you recently moved to this city expecting a quaint studio with vaulted ceilings and exposed brick walls.  Well  be forewarned  it is your foolhardy hope that gives me power!Morgma has trained long and hard for this battle.  While you were but a babe  Morgma was squatting oak trees and growing muscular high-pressure sales tactics.  While you were stoned in college  Morgma was slipping impossible apartment standards into your afternoon Friends and Sex in the City marathons.  Yes!  Morgma was once an aspiring set designer and possesses a devious minor in art history!Are you ready?  Do you feel agile  mortal?  For apartments under Morgmaâ€™s rule move quickly.   Rentals you saw posted merely an hour prior may disappear like ships in a squall.   Morgma demands you be ready to sign a three-year lease without giving a second thought to the substance oozing from the oven.  Morgma also demands that you arrive with a briefcase of cash and a tupperware of your dignity.   Do you have your social security number and childhood memories?  For Morgma demands these as well.Each skull that festoons my iron gorget represents a soul that I have conquered.  This one is Becky  who now sits dead-eyed in a lightless studio with lazy plumbing.  This one is Tucker.  He wakes in a cold sweat each dawn on the southern end of Penn Ave.  Your wide-eyed terror pleases me  child  for he lives even south of the strip malls.  HA!  Yes!  Practically past the Applebeeâ€™s!I am Morgma the Mauler  and this is my wrath!!Your rental battle begins now.  I challenge you to navigate this cluttered Craigslist labyrinth.  Can you organize the twenty-seven tabs you opened?  You had better  for it is only the beginning!  Do not be distracted by the exclamation points and flippant capitalization.  Do not dare ignore the â€œsub-patio levelâ€ snare in this description â€” for it spells your doom!Your skills are weak  mortal.  Morgma has not yet summoned his noisy neighbors or false promise that the unit will be professionally cleaned!  Can you fight on?  Will you drive across town for another showing?  This time prepare to surrender your very soul and also your quarters  for Morgma has only installed one shared washer/dryer for forty units!  And the cost is $4 per load!!  This is Morgmaâ€™s fury!!Morgma can see your strength fading.  Are you willing to settle for this disfigured studio with a carpet the color of weak tea?  In your moment of defeat Morgma demands more â€” you must pay an application fee!  Even to compromise  you must pay me three monthsâ€™ rent and your ability to taste ice cream.  Morgma demands your complete surrender  a signature  and initials next to paragraph three.This battle was fun  mortal  but by the signed 32-page contract in my scarred grasp  Morgma has defeated you.Your tears amuse me.  Do not dwell on your friend Tara who inexplicably landed a rent-controlled corner unit.   Only a lucky handful can slip by Morgma.   Now your soul belongs to me.  For I am Morgma the Mauler  and you are my lessee!          Iâ€™ve noticed that youâ€™ve been a little upset about my recent social media output  particularly the tweet  â€œOh my god  will the loneliness never end? #ImMiserableâ€ which  as you deftly noticed  was tweeted during our second anniversary dinner date. As my significant other  you have every right to be upset. But  as Iâ€™ve said many times: I love you  but our happiness doesnâ€™t fit my personal brand narrative strategy.My market research shows that nihilism is hot right now. Malcontent millennials tend to share posts significantly more if they contain phrases like â€œIâ€™m dead insideâ€ or â€œIâ€™m am consumed by despair.â€ So  while I do love you and love the life we share together  expressing that joy on social media would undo all the work Iâ€™ve put into carefully crafting my personal brandâ€™s â€œvoice.â€ Itâ€™s called strategy for a reason  babe.I have 665 followers on Twitter â€” thatâ€™s almost 700. Can you imagine what would happen if all of the sudden my personal brand narrative went from self-deprecating existential musings to â€œHey guys  Iâ€™m in love!â€ What would my followers think? Sure  most of them are our mutual friends and colleagues  but still  who would they turn to? I canâ€™t bear the thought of ever finding out.If I want to have a strong brand narrative  my â€œvoiceâ€ has to be consistent across all distribution channels. So  yes  that does mean captioning Instagram photos of us with â€œIf I had a time machine I would change everything. EVERYTHING.â€ And yes  that does mean that when I check into our favorite restaurant on Facebook the caption is just that straight-line-mouth emoticon. And  yes again  that even means pinning cross-stitch patterns that say STARING INTO THE ENDLESS BLACK VOID on my Pinterest page. Thatâ€™s just strong brand equity common sense.And  really  just because I am not constantly professing my love for you online doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t love you. I do love you. I tell you that all the time in private.  So  when I say â€œI love you  you are my life â€ I mean it. The fact that I tweet  â€œI hate my life  I want to dieâ€ immediately afterward doesnâ€™t change a thing.
